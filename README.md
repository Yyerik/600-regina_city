# Regina_City_Park_Maintence
The city of Regina has been facing a significant challenge in managing the large number of park maintenance requests. With around 300 parks in the city, it has become impossible for the city to manually review all of the requests. Facing this issue, the City of Regina presented their problem to Dr.Bertran De Lis, who is the Director of Analytics at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Government Excellence. In this project, both the City of Regina and Dr.Bertran De Lis are our clients. Our clients have approached us to find a process that can help them deal with the massive amount of park visitor comments, understand them, and prioritize them. The final goal for our clients is to increase overall citizen satisfaction with the service and reduce the number of citizen complaints.
