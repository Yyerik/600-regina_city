I don't know why the city doesn't have lights at the playgrounds but they have lights on every street. (Even lights with a timer and button like the water ones at the spraypad would be ok at playgrounds - or if they were only on until midnight or something). Anyway, we go to the Bowl and it's pitch dark and there are 40 kids there. And because it is dark so early, we are always essentially sledding in the dark. (At one spot, there is a light on that little building, but it's behind a tree!) At Connaught school, they appear to have lights, but they are never on. Do you know if that is city lights or the school? Leslie park is the same - very dark. But the street next to it is bright! Anyway that's my peeve right now! (In an unrelated thing that I know you'll agree with, Paul watched this interesting video about winter biking in Finland.

Ave. for the past 20 years. We use the path in our area daily and really love it. It just disappoints us that the city of Regina decides to run this Great city of ours like it is a small town. Why is it that they can?t use proper equipment to maintain the path. Like clean the path underneath the bridges so that you don?t have a single path to walk on a possible twist an ankle. Do a better job on snow removal, and even through some sand down on the icye spots. This morning I should have put my skates on instead of winter boots. There have been times when we have seen the city on the path cleaning snow when it did not need it, and times like now when it does need it and they have not been out all week. A better job would be much appreciated . This path is used by quite a few people fail and we would like to see our tax dollars used better. Also the parking lot at Rick Hanson play are could use some attention snow wise. A lot of people drive to the path and it also very icy with ruts and lack of snow removal. One other item not relating to snow removal is it sure would be nice to have the garbage's emptied on a regular bases. or maybe checked. There are some of then close to over flowing with bags of dog poo and other garbage, Thank you very much.

Please email SRadmin@regina.ca with your response including the SR number in the subject line within 1 business day. SR 2054026 has been forwarded to Parks Maintenance for responseSR ____ has been forwarded to Winter Maintenance for responseAttention to: Service Regina, Councillor Shaw (Ward 7) I am writing to you today about a matter I feel needs to be addressed at a Council meeting in the near future. As a long time resident of Ward 7, I am pleased to be here and enjoy the community offerings. I enjoy taking my dog for a walk on a regular basis, but I find there is an issue along Carey Street where Carey Park is. The sidewalk is unusable during the winter months because of the City snow removal policy regarding Category 5 Residental areas. I feel this needs to have the Bylaw amended to allow for the removal of snow on the sidewalk areas along these city community park areas. My points are as follows: 1) Inaccessibility of the sidewalks forces people to walk on the roadway, which can be of concern when vehicles are traveling both directions on Carey Street. The ruts in the road can cause walking issues as well as a safety concern; pedestrians should be on the sidewalk for safety. 2) As there are play structures in Carey Park, access to the park is difficult for children, families, and general public to enjoy. Proper walkway maintenance would be greatly appreciated! Parks are vital to the good mental health of residents in the community. 3) With the snow windrows piled along the sidewalk the utility companies have no way to get their service vehicles onto the easement to access utility services in the event of service troubles, changes, hookups, etc. The services are on utility poles above ground. As noted earlier, this is a Category 5 street clearing issue, but this is a park area that no homeowner is obliged to clear the city owned sidewalk along Carey Street or the pathway into the park itself. I would like to have City Council review the various community parks in Regina for an amendment to the Bylaw regarding snow removal along the sidewalks to be included for these parks (ie: Carey Park, Derby Park, Lorimer Park along Donohue Avenue, as well as other community parks throughout the City of Regina). I am including several pictures of Carey Park sidewalk as examples. In the interim, would it be possible to have the sidewalk along Carey Street Park be cleared of the snow as a courtesy to the users of the park? I have contacted Service Regina twice and have been told Category 5 sidewalks don't get cleared----can we get an exception to this considering our light snow removal needs this season? It's a slow time period for snow removal, so there should not be any high demands on equipment or staff right now, so sending a crew out to remove the windrows, etc should be a reasonable service request. Thank you for taking the time to hear my service request. My contact info is Derek Finnik 306-581-4288, or email at dfinnik@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing back on this matter. Have a great day!",3/3/2021 9:35,1,,,,,,

In the meantime, I wanted to share some photos that I took at nearby Massey Park and Pool on the weekend. It actually was the motivator for me to suggest to our Boards that we propose to our community that we clean up the litter and covid masks that are on the ground and blown into trees and shrubs. With the snow melting it is so much more evident and it needs to be dealt with soon. Considering that the City is responsible for the maintenance of the park grounds, I would suggest that it is looked after by City workers rather than asking volunteers to clean up the mess. It is not just the litter and garbage on the grounds, it is also the state of the trees and shrubs surrounding the parking lot. They are in dire need of pruning and removal in some cases.Considering the area is used by the Campbell students as their ""lunch room"" it really needs to have a better set up for discouraging litter. There could be some further development of the small park between the school and the parking lot for a social area, ie. benches and tables. The local community could also benefit from the improvements during the remainder of the year. It would also be a big improvement to have a concrete sidewalk installed between the school and the parking lot. Right now there is a muddy path that the students are using. Another area that is a big mess is over by the University along Wascana Drive that really needs your attention to clean up the paper, plastic and other litter that is blowing around and is really massed into the shrubs from wind action. Quite a blight on our City for anyone driving off the highway along that corridor towards the University.I presume the City has a plan for this and other similar areas. Please share your plans with us so that we know what areas the City is planning on cleaning up so our volunteers can focus their efforts on areas that the City will not be looking after. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",3/22/2021 14:11,1,,,,,,

We thought we would contact some of the bigger cities in the province to see if there are any parks getting upgraded and if there is a list we can put our names on so we can repurpose any old playground equipment into our own community.Hope to hear from you soon! Take care! Lisa Fiske",4/6/2021 14:56,1,0.0012670307187363505,0.9935289025306702,0.0015020797727629542,0.0028195453342050314,0.0006246176781132817,0.00025786718470044434

It is a beautiful park, and is consistently full of people enjoying it. My question is with respect to the walking path in the park. About 75% of the park's paths have been paved (and have been from the time the park was developed), and the other 25% is what I would describe as gravel. The problem is that the parts of the path that are gravel are nearly always wet and quite muddy, with the exception of a few weeks in the driest part of the summer. I am not sure what the thinking was when the park was first developed as to why they didn't pave the entire park, but I am wondering if the city would give any consideration to paving the remainder of the path? The Greens is full of many walking paths, all of which are paved, but I am not sure why this stretch was never paved? My husband and I walk in this park almost every night and due to the giant mud pits at several points on the gavel portions, people just have to walk around all the mud and go on the grass instead. This really defeats the purpose of having the walking path at all. I would imagine this is especially irritating for bikes and baby carriages, etc. I am not one to normally send emails of this nature, but this question is something that bothers me on an almost daily basis!

The 7-11 is very popular with youth that attend school or play nearby and everyday they dump their garbage with 7-11 logos on the street.  I am picking up plastic straws, lids and cups on a daily basis.   There are no public garbage bins in the area.   It's really not the kids fault as they have nowhere to put their refuse.There needs to be 3 city maintained garbage cans in front of Jack Mackenzie school and in front of St. Gabriel schools.I spoke to the caretaker at St. Gabriel and he has the same problem every day picking up trash for the local convenience store.I have indicated in red where my proposed garbage bins would go.   It would also very much help those that walk their dog for dog owners to have a place to put their refuse. I have spoken to several neighbors that also have noticed a large rise in litter in the neighborhood and we would all be most appreciative.Thanks and hope the city will consider it as it would help keep our neighborhood clean.    best regards,Cam Teichroeb",4/21/2021 8:29,1,0.0006475855479948223,0.9964336156845093,0.0008706282824277878,0.0014257712755352259,0.00035504726110957563,0.00026739260647445917

Quick background: I'm a recent retired nurse/educator - 40 years RQHR. Husband taught 30 years in Regina. We voted for you and trust your leadership. We have 3 daughter-in-laws who are ICU nurses, (2 in NICU and 1 in SICU) 2 of our ""adopted"" kids are physicians.2 of our children are teachers. We are blessed - and even have 10 beautiful g/children. I've never written or called your office. We are quiet, pay our taxes and volunteer many hours to our community, in Europe and Zambia. While on my daily walks I pick up every wind-swept mask in our neighbourhood and discard them safely! Last week I called the city phone number because every City of Regina Covid sign had been forcefully removed from Parkridge Park and Eastgate Estates teeny tiny toddler playground park. I took my own zip ties and replaced the signs at the small park. At Parkridgethere was only one sign left on the ground. I took it home and will repair it and re-fasten it as no one from the city has come to replace the COVID signs yet. Yesterday when we took 2 of our g/children to the Parkridge Park there were about 5 antimasking signs plastered to the play structure. We care for 2 of our g/kids because they both have a health condition that is tricky to manage at a day care centre. My husband and I tried to scrape some of the signs off but they were so securely fastened that we weren't able to remove them and figured also that scraping will surely damage the paint of the structure. We didn't want to do that and actually couldn't. Is it okay to deface and damage City of Regina property? Is it okay for the public to post signs suggestive of disobedience to Public Health Act orders on public City of Regina property? Or are they actually not orders but Public Health Act suggestions or wishes? I noticed that no such signs had been posted at the neighbouring public school playground. I wondered why? This morning on my walk I noticed there were about 3 times as many NEW anti-masking signs. One sign was pasted overtop of the City of Regina COVID sign that is outside the park. I notice on this web page the City of Regina's top priority is for the health and safety of the our community. With anti-maskers protesting ramping up I feel neither of this is happening too much. I'm wondering if the Public Health Act Orders are orders or are they only suggestions? If I walk into the police station with no mask and demand service what will they ask me to do? I was a mental health crisis response nurse and I am familiar with how thepolice work. They would more than likely give me 2 options. The first is to put on a mask, the second would be to leave the building if I don't. Is that true? Our children that are teachers MUST wear a mask to school or stay home. These are public health orders. The anti-masking signs at the playgrounds are inciting anger and fear and communicating messages of non-compliance to Public Health Act orders. The anti-masking protests at the RGH bring anger, sadness and are contributing to stress and burn out for our 3 daughter-in-laws. They cannot believe that while they nurse the sickest people in Saskatchewan in the ICU that people are protesting! Has the city governance ever thought of ""anti-masking"" protests as not only inciting unrest but also adding to burnout and actually committing the crime of ""defamation."" Living in Zambia taught us many things. One is that defamation is taken very seriously, so be careful what you say and how you behave in your house and on the streets. You can be taken to court, charged and jailed. It happens. Last year while still in Zambia at the start of the virus the villagers were washing properly outside of businesses and their homes and starting to wear masks publicly. (they made their own!) They don't protest, they respect. Meanwhile, when we returned to Canada, we saw neither washing before entering shops nor masking up. Interesting. What is a developed nation? Yesterday, I received a video of 3 of our Zambian sponsored students enacting a skit they'd created on health promotion behaviors for Covid. I can share that with you! I will not protest anything, but I'll pray for our city leaders to wisely act on ""not following the crowd"". I will continue to pick up wind blown masks, replace CITY of Regina signs and peacefully attempt to safely remove the super stuck anti-masking signsand care for our daughter-in-laws as their signs of fatigue scale up! Don't be afraid to take a stand. Be our voice. No wise leader has ever turned down that responsibility. Leadership is demonstrating wisdom, responsibility and taking risk for the sake of those you serve. (Mandela, Ghandi, Harriet Tubman, ICU staff!) Blessings Sue Krogsgaard",5/3/2021 9:40,1,,,,,,

Is there a bylaw limiting the number of vehicles parked on a property?s driveway or in front of the house? The resident claims there are five people renting one house and that each renter has a vehicle that crowds the driveway and street. He thinks there is a safety hazard for pedestrians, especially children with so many vehicles.2. Garbage cans in Richardson park.

Nothing has been done and its time to do grass, or at the very least have it graded down so its not such a hazard. Too many years have gone by now and nothing has been done.

No one in a wheelchair (motorized) has accessed the park for more than a decade. It is against the law to block access to the park.

Hi Jason. I want to bring the state of Bundon Park to your attention. The park has really gone downhill the last couple of years. The grass area is mostly dead and starting to show more and more dirt. I know there are sprinklers but they haven't been turned on in a couple years. The wood chips in the flower beds need a refresh. The rock area around the play structure is showing a lot of landscape fabric and gets overrun with weeds. And unfortunately, the bushes and trees are being destroyed by both kids and rabbits the area. Sorry to go on and on, but its too bad a newer park is becoming so run down.

When the wind picks up so does the dirt and the dust causing a nuisance to the neighbouring property (white fence) and piles of dirt end up on the sidewalk making it unusable for elderly residents who also enjoy walks (in the summer mostly) and forces them on to the street when this occurs.I personally have been sweeping it up over the years however, there should be a better long term solution to this issue as it really isn?t my responsibly to manage this spot.As the residents of 126 Patterson Dr (white fence house) we would like to ask the city to re-plant this spot or landscape it accordingly to retain the top soil and provide a useable all season path for walkers etc.We appreciate your assistance with this matter and if there is any more information we can provide please let us know. I am easily reached on this number: 604 655 2777.Kind regards,Erin and Margaret Klassen",5/12/2021 13:13,1,,,,,,

Councillor has been notified that a response is not required. Departments may contact resident at their own discretion.Hello,&nbsp;I am writing about the one-way path at Wascana Park. In order to go for a walk now at Wascana, one must make the entire loop. The entire loop is about 4km if you park directly near the path and from my house on McNab Crescent it is a 5.5km loop. This one way path discriminates against persons with disabilities, the elderly, and families with young children as many of these people are unable to walk that distance. I am often unable to experience Wascana Lake simply because I am unable to turn around and walk bac kwhere I came from. Walking on other paths often lead to a road which has no sidewalk on parts and is thus unsafe to walk on.&nbsp;I would also like to ask about the research/science that shows a one-way path on an outdoor trail has proven to prevent covid.&nbsp;Thank-you for taking the time to read my concerns. &nbsp;Carly Heywood&nbsp;carlyraeheywood@gmail.com",5/13/2021 7:18,1,0.05347529053688049,0.06862547993659973,0.0026617746334522963,0.4052383005619049,0.46802109479904175,0.001978111919015646

We in this area pay lots of tax dollars and yet a park in our area is neglected. I have been to many parks in the city and on many walking paths that receive more attention that our park. We have lived in our home on Parkland Drive since late 1983. As far as I can remember the walkways/sidewalks around and through the park were never cleared of snow. The grass used to get mowed and watered regularly. 2 winters ago I contacted the city wondering why the busy walkways through our park are never plowed even though walkways near us are plowed regularly.This park is used daily by kids walking to and from school, adults walking to bus stops and generally out walking for whatever reason. When I contacted the city the walkways were plowed for the first time ever in my memory. They weren?t plowed regularly but generally were plowed within 3-4 days after a snowfall. The sidewalk on the Arens Road side of the park is plowed regulary but the sidewalk by the Parkland Drive side of the park is never plowed. Citizens are expected to keep the sidewalks in front of their homes shoveled but the city has not shoveled the sidewalk along Parkland Park on Parkland Drive. I also contacted the city because the area around the playground was dirty, full of leaves &amp; twigs which was unsafe for children play. I asked that the sand be cleaned to get rid of the debris, it seemed this was done last year but hasn?t been done this year. I also contacted the city because the area around the basketball net (not net but metal thing) was full of debris and couldn?t be used because it was unsafe to move around in that area without risking injury. That was never cleaned but I noticed the space is clean now but I suspect some of my neighbors cleaned this area since no city workers have been around.There is also years worth of dead leaves in this area. I also asked that the area on the walkway in front of the play area be cleaned as it was covered in dirt &amp; debri and was not usable in the spring or after a rain and takes days to dry. You can?t even go around on the grass because it is full of water. This was never done The park was not watered regularly last summer but sporadically. The park has not had the leaves cleaned for at least 2 years if not more, there is an extreme build up through out the park and in the trees. The area especially around the play area and basketball area desperately needs the leaves cleaned out of the trees and around the branches. I actually spent hours one day this spring, to clean this walkway and others, cleaned up around the play area as the walkways are never swept, cleaned around the benches by the play area, collected garbage in the park,My questions are 1. What are the park maintenance rules and timeframes for the city of regina? 2. Why is Parkland Park neglected, action only sometimes taken when the city is contacted but no response to many of the non completed requests?3. Why as a taxpayer do I have to take responsibility for cleaning the park when other parks in the city receive lots of attention. Passerbys on the day I was cleaning the park said tongue in cheek that as a city employee I should be wearing a safety vest.4. When can I expect this Park to receive the appropriate attention without having to contact the city, often without response, or having to do the work myself.",5/17/2021 8:11,1,,,,,,

This little alley/pathway is used vigorously by dog walkers and pedestrians every single day. It is also a wind tunnel! When the wind picks up so does the dirt and the dust causing a nuisance to the neighbouring property (white fence) and piles of dirt end up on the sidewalk making it unusable for elderly residents who also enjoy walks (in the summer mostly) and forces them on to the street when this occurs. I personally have been sweeping it up over the years however, there should be a better long term solution to this issue as it really isn?t my responsibly to manage this spot. As the residents of 126 Patterson Dr (white fence house) we would like to ask the city to re-plant this spot or landscape it accordingly to retain the top soil and provide a useable all season path for walkers etc. We appreciate your assistance with this matter and if there is any more information we can provide please let us know. I am easily reached on this number: 604 655 2777.Kind regards,Erin and Margaret Klassen",5/18/2021 8:50,1,,,,,,

Any progress to report on that front?We also have three dead trees in the park behind us as well that the city doesn?t seem to want to act on.The latest frustration with the city revolves around the Compost program.We are part of the pilot project and think it is a wonderful program that can produce great amounts of compost for various uses.We were offered the first batch of compost to pick up and did so quickly. For some reason the Compost stinks to high heaven and it doesn?t seem to disappear even when mixed with our soil.If the Compost is going to be like that the usefulness of it would be very limited. I phoned the city and after a week got a reply phone call, but she was very defensive and said I was just one of ""only""a half dozen people who complained.Can you see what you can find out about the future quality of the end product.",5/25/2021 14:44,1,0.0016119576757773757,0.00288885529153049,0.0003473504330031574,0.9919508695602417,0.002997074741870165,0.00020399758068379015

I thought that I would assist by cutting back all of the trees and bushes behind my property for ease of removal by the city. Hopefully this will make it easier to schedule someone to come and clear away the cut branches. As I noted, it appears some trees were cut down in the past and those limbs need to be removed as well.

I'm wondering if there's an inverse logic where I can get a tax rebate since the grass and weeds in my easement are up to my knees? The only time you mow it is when I call and complain and I am really tired of wasting my time phoning you to cut your grass. I would like to talk to the vegetation management for south end Regina as they need to have scheduled maintenance back there if you want me to pay my tax. When SaskEnergy came by digging out the lines a few years ago, they also messed up the grading, so that it is flat and not sloped. Can you take the storm drainage part off of my bill as everything is actually draining into my basement??",6/7/2021 12:59,1,,,,,,

First of all the mowers that have been used are way too high to cut the heads of the dandelions so they are allowed to form big puff ball heads which blow all over . I'm sorry to go on with this but I'm so fed up being surrounded on 3 sides with weeds. Well here we are at June 8th and nothing has been done as per usual. The dandelions have gone to seed already and blown all over . Now we have to put up with those darn Manchurian elm seeds which are planted all along our back bumper strip they are horrible. Does the City of Regina care about the people who have to put up with this mess and all the seeds that destroy our plants ( keep Regina beautiful ). How in heavens name are we supposed to do that when it is the City who creates the biggest mess.As I said before I apologize for going on like this but really something should be done.,6/9/2021 8:50,1,0.3865247368812561,0.11373826861381531,0.006147295702248812,0.4889186918735504,0.0032316523138433695,0.0014393714955076575

Dorsey place seems to be the place where workers no there is some type of problem.They are concerned for insurance purposes, but also health.I saw the street and the lack of care in the boulevard! They used to have a sign that had Klein place on it and was taken down, not replaced! They feel the high taxes they pay and they do, for the few services and lack of care and attention they receive they want to know why their street is not being repaved, , and the island interlocking brick done with a few more trees to beautify it. It truly does look awful!The city is there now doing a patch job and the road is not good! I know you hear this all the time, but I think it?s time to start addressing the concern which is when the city takes over ....the maintenance goes down! Things eventually fall apart and then the city has to take them down as is this example with their beautiful street sign that the developer would?ve put in years ago.  My second concern is with the high taxes that people pay, it seems things have to fall apart and Dilapatate such as the sign, interlocking brick dead trees, there?s nothing put back in to keep it alive and beautiful it?s just poor maintenance but nothing to rejuvenate.They calculated that between the 8 homes on this bay  they put over $3 million into the city tax base and have received very little for what they have put in.They are not happy and it was my very first time in my career where I was called to a street by neighbours that were upset and tired of feeling the city does not care! I look forward to your response! Lori BrescianiCouncillor Ward 4306-570-1995________________________________________From: Day Dennis &amp; Jeri &lt;d_day@accesscomm.ca&gt;Sent: Wednesday, June 9, 2021 11:02:33 PMTo: Lori Bresciani &lt;LBRESCIA@regina.ca&gt;Cc: Kenn Belrose &lt;ebellero@sasktel.net&gt;; Day Dennis &amp; Jeri &lt;d_day@accesscomm.ca&gt;; Bob Hrycan &lt;bob@hrycanlaw.com&gt;; Art Klassen &lt;artklassen@myaccess.ca&gt;; Sy To &lt;sy.to@tuta.io&gt;; Mayor &lt;Mayor@regina.ca&gt;Subject: [External email] Klein Place Concerns  Thank you for coming out to meet with the residents of Klein Place this evening to discuss our infrastructure concerns.  We really do appreciate you taking the time to come out to have a curbside meeting with us. The first concern that we discussed were the problems with Sewer Backup:This occurred most recently on May 21, 2021 after about 15mm gentle rain starting the previous evening and continuing overnight.  One resident noticed backup in the morning and called Rotorooter to check the sewer line to his house.  The company found no problems with the residential sewer line and after checking the manholes in Wetmore Crescent found them to be full.  They called the city and a vac truck was dispatched to clean out the sewer line.  The crew continued down Wetmore Crescent to Dorsey Place where they found a non-flooded manhole from which to clean out the sewer line.A similar incident occurred on Thanksgiving weekend 2007 when I noticed our basement toilet was not flushing and water was coming up the drain into our basement shower.  Again, I called Rotorooter who came to our house  and they determined that the sewer line to our house was clear.  When they checked the manhole in front of my house they found it to be full.  They called the city who dispatched a vac truck which again cleaned out the sewer line downstream from us on Dorsey Place.The previous backup we experienced occurred in late August 2004.  This occurrence happened subsequent to an intense thunderstorm.  Again, the sanitary sewers into our homes backed up and our basements were contaminated with ankle deep sewage.  As we have a separate storm sewer system in our neighbourhood this should not occur after a rain.  It should not occur at all.Although we have installed sewer back-flow preventers, these systems are not foolproof.  As all three incidents described above were resolved by the city cleaning out the sewer line downstream from Klein Place we ask the following:?	Does the city regularly inspect problem sewer lines for blockage??	With two of these incidents occurring after rainstorms will the city investigate how storm water runoff is entering the sanitary sewer system and causing back-ups into our homes??	Will the city undertake an investigation as to why we have these continuing problem with our sewers?Secondly, we discussed the condition of the roadway, sidewalks and island on Klein Place.Today, the city excavated and repaired a major shear failure in our roadway.  This pavement failure developed subsequent to settlement of service trenches to our homes and resultant ponding of water on the pavement and the resulting weakening of the pavement.  The added stress of garbage trucks rocking on their suspensions as they lift our trash and recycle bins has pounded out the weakend pavement causing rutting, fatigue cracking and the subsequent shear failure.  While we appreciate the city repairing the shear failure, this is money (and our tax dollars) that did not need to be spent should our street have received timely maintenance!  We see similar failures beginning on our street that will develop to the same state within a two or three years.  One of the city's crew members commented that the entire road/sidewalk needs to be reconstructed.  The pavement on Klein Place is ravelling so badly that the street sweeper swept pieces of pavement up onto our lawns, driveways and the centre island.  The pavement surface is so rough that the street sweepers left a layer of mud, not a clean street.  The street sweepers did not sweep up the island and pavement and sand in front of the mailbox remain.The curb surrounding the island has chunks broken out of it and reinforcing steel bars protruding, creating an unsafe surface for playing children and residents retrieving their mail from the mailbox on the island.  The sand placed on the island in front of the mail box in the winter has not been cleaned up.  When the Parks Department pruned the potentilla on the island last fall they did not clean up their debris.  This debris still remains and much of it has blown into our yards.We described to you how since Klein Place was built the city has done nothing but to take things away from us; our engraved wooden street sign, trees in the centre of the island, and told us when they resurfaced Wetmore Crescent that side bays like ours were not eligible for such treatment.  Five years ago every street, crescent and bay in Richmond Place had their streets resurfaced and wheelchair ramps installed at intersections.  Yet, we are grouped with Richmond Place for property tax assessment.  If we pay the same level of taxes, why do we not receive the same level of service?  If the city can resurface an entire subdivision why can it not resurface one small bay?We ask that you advocate that Klein Place be placed on the Residential Road Renewal program in 2022 for reconstruction.  We have continuously slipped through the cracks and suffered the sewage backup from downstream for the last 36 years and feel that we are long overdue to receive some benefit of the significant cumulative amount of tax dollars our 7 residents have contributed to the city.Thank you again for listening to our concerns. Dennis Day",6/10/2021 12:51,1,,,,,,

I live right next to this park, I take pride in my home and yard and I?ve been personally cutting the park grass about 12? out from my fence in order to try keep the dandelions from taking over my yard. It?s crazy now, taxes are sky high, it?s not right.I understand that dandelion spraying has been discontinued, I?m not sure but if so, this decision needs to be reversed.

This year the weeds are absolutely ridiculous. We take pride in making our yard look nice but with the amount of weeds in the park it is impossible to keep them out of our yard. I would like to knowwhy we pay higher taxes for backing a park when the park is left to look rundown. Where does this tax money go? I also know that the city will issue notices and fines to home owners who are not taking care of their yard. My question is who is holding the cityaccountable for the same standard? Maybe the home owners who back these neglected city parks should be getting some of their unused tax dollars back as a fine to the city for the neglect of these parks. We all know this would not happen but it would sure benice if the city was held accountable and probably the easiest solution would be to use those tax dollars and properly take care of our parks by watering, cutting and weed control on a regular basis and take a little pride in the cities appearance.",6/14/2021 14:14,1,0.9983684420585632,0.000574975972995162,0.00018962004105560482,0.0005637710564769804,0.00020489213056862354,9.827494795899838e-05

I recently moved to Gardiner Park and my new home backs onto the walking path that runs along the Pilot Butte Creek. I am grateful that the city cuts the grass along the walking path but that'sas far as it goes. Right now - the tall grass &amp; weeds - esp the thistles that will soon bloom and spread more unwanted seed - looks awful! My question is - Why can't the city cut the grass up to the fences of the houses? The grass is nicely cut in WascanaView - not that far from me - but my area only gets the grass cut along the walking path for now. In the Fall all the grass is cut. Personally - I don't mind the natural wild look - but why are some areas entitled to more of a manicured area than others? Weall pay taxes. Thank you for answering my questionGood afternoon,&nbsp; Thank you so much for replying to my inquiry.&nbsp; Again when I was out for a walk this morning, I noticed that home owners are taking it upon themselves to cut the grass from their property fence to the bikepath.&nbsp; This should be done by the city.&nbsp; The grass is nicely cut in Wascana View, Varsity Park and Richmond, but as soon as you cross Assiniboine Ave, any properties backing the path in University Park or Gardiner Park there is only a strip of grass cut alongthe walking path.This is also a City of Trees - right - the city got the grant money - planted the trees?..and then?&nbsp; Certainly when the city worker that?s paid $30+/hr when watering those new planted trees could trim thegrass around the wire fence that protects the young tree from rabbits - but NO - they turn on the water and then return to the truck and smoke or text until it?s time to move the hose.&nbsp; And why haven?t dead trees and the wire fencing be removed?&nbsp; That?s whatmy tax dollars are paying for?It would be nice to take a walk along the path with the Mayor to point out how awful this city is beginning to look.&nbsp; Regina was once a city that was well manicured - a city that looked clean, cared for &amp;welcoming.&nbsp; Now it?s beginning to look like a city where no one cares.&nbsp; Sad.Please cut the grass along the house lines/townhouses/fences.&nbsp; Open areas not backing homes - fine - let that become wild?.Thanks,Jeff&nbsp;",6/17/2021 14:23,1,,,,,,

Please copy the Councillor in your response to the resident:From: Diane Anaquod Date: June 20, 2021 at 6:51:59 PM CST To: Bob Hawkins Subject: [External email] Harbour Landing - park and property maintenance (or lack thereof) Dear Mr. Hawkins, I am sure you remember me from our many correspondences of last year, as well as. the local news reports highlighting the state of the situation as it relates to weeds and in particularly, the Foxtail weeds. Summer is here and I, as well as a number of Harbour Landing residents, are once again appealing for a proactive approach to the issue of the ?Foxtail weed? issue in HL. As you may recall, there were quite a few dog owners in HL whose pets required very expensive and serious veterinary care last Summer and Fall, as a results of this very noxious weed. As of today, you have only to drive around HL to see the Foxtail weed starting to grow (and prosper), not only on unkept home owner properties, but also in the parks along the storm channel (ER). It is truly unsightly and dangerous to pets. Could you provide an update if anything is being done to proactively address the problem please? Many of us would appreciate an update. Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you.

She asked about the green space behind her house, which is park and bike/walking trail.Four years ago, Sask Power changed overhead lines and their work created a berm behind residents? yards. Ms. Mitchell said the berm has caused flooding in her and her neighbours? yards. Ms. Mitchell called the city three years ago, the city said it was Sask Power?s responsibility and she called Sask Power, and they said it was a city responsibility.Currently L?Arche is under construction with new sidewalks and pavement. During the construction, city staff made arrangements for a family with a disabled boy to access their back yard via the same green space referred to above. The city staff said they would fix the green space once construction is done and residents have front yard access again.Would it be possible to investigate the berm that Ms. Mitchell is upset about and fix that at the same time as the rest of the green space? Ms. Mitchell can be contacted at 306-586-0743.I would appreciate being informed on what steps are taken. Thank you!

Hi Cheryl. We live in your grouping in Hillsdale. The city never mows the easement behind our house. It?s up to my waist. We are constantly phoning every year. The mosquitoes in our yard are insane. On the opposite side of our bay thereis a walkway in their easement. The city is constantly maintaining it. Even whipper snipping near people?s fences. It?s beautiful. People even plant flowers because it is so well maintained. They pay no extra taxes compared to us. No kids live on their sideof the bay. My kids used to use ours for going to school. It was like walking through a jungle. There is garbage. They?ve tripped and hurt themselves. They either have to take an extra long path or trespass through our neighbours? yards to now avoid it onthe way to school. Is there some way that we can change this? I would have no troubles getting my neighbours to sign some sort of petition. Hillsdale is such a beautiful neighbourhood and taking care of this easement would make it even more so. It?s also veryunfair of the city to be handing out fines to people not mowing their grasses while keeping its own property in this type of shape. Up to an adults? waist is totally unacceptable.

Every year trees have died and never replaced. Almost every tree that green view is backing is dead and cut down. Tons are dead in the park. I would guess prob 20-30 total trees in this park have been cut down and never replaced. The grass is burnt never gets watered I never see anyone out maintaining this park. When I was home in the winter I witnessed a city of regina plow truck drive as fast as he could to plow the path pretty much right behind my house and all that grass along the path is gone. For paying 6400.00 in taxes is insane for not getting anything done in the park. It?s a huge eyesore and everyone I know has been calling the city and nothing is getting done. Anything you can do to help would be appreciated. Thanks again Lori.

She wonders if the city staff do not realize the whole easement has not been mowed because the see sections at the end that have been mowed by neighbours and don?t realize the rest of the easement is not done.

The grass was long and the weeds and fox tails were outof control. It is very disappointing to see with the amount of tax dollars we pay. This is especially disappointing because there are very few places I can safely take my children during COVID. The park is one of the places. It is not somewhere I want to goin the state it is in. The second concern I have is the construction going on around the park by the schools (Plains Minnow Park). There were a couple skid steers removing the grass and carrying it across from one park to the next. The construction equipment was RIGHT BESIDE theplay structure on the path.

The grass is nicely cut in Wascana View - not that far from me - but my area only gets the grass cut along the walking path for now. In the Fall all the grass is cut.

Please copy the Councillor, Mayor and City Manager in your response to the resident:Hi Bob, I am once again writing you this year about the state of Norseman Park in Harbour Landing. In previous years I have voiced my disappointment and disgust at the state of our park through numerous Service Requests and emails to City Council. It continues to get worse year after year and the City is not doing anything to try and combat the weed problem. We paid premiums to back what was a beautiful park and now it is an eyesore. What once was new sod (approx 6 years ago) has now become over run with fox tails, dandelions and other noxious weeds. What?s even more frustrating is we spent thousands of dollars to landscape our yards and now all the foxtail and dandelion seeds blow into our yards. I will attach photos of Norseman Park behind my house (5028 Cornell Gate). Myself and many of my neighbours want action. This park sees a lot of traffic from all areas of the City because of the soccer field, playground and skatepark, so it deserves some TLC.

For the last several years, I have submit a service request to the city to have our street sign on Lakewood Drive repainted(sign is located direct across from MacNeill School). We have a large wood sign at the end of our street, but it is showing significant aging. Our neighbourhood loves this sign, and in talking to neighbours it is a project we have wished to be completed for several years now.With all the construction on Whelan, I feel this would be an ideal time for city crews to put a fresh coat on it. I would even gladly do it myself if the city is unable to complete this.My worry is if this goes unattended, it will decay past repair.Please let me know if this is something that can be completed this summer to help beautify our ward.

Good morning, We are currently updating the outside of our home on 9 Estey Pl to improve its street appeal. As long as you look from a distance, it looks fantastic; however on closer looks to get to to the front of our house you must first risk your vehicles undercarriageon Spence St (which currently also sports a sink hole) and then turn onto Estey place but please be sure to avoid all the potholes and broken pavement. I was shocked when last year the BACK ALLEY behind the Atlas hotel was redone before the embarrassment ofSpence St and the bays along it were left in complete disarray. We have lived here since 2006 and our taxes have gone up every year. We are now paying over $4000 for a road that is ruining our vehicles.We have a grass space on our bay and yesterday was only the 3rd time I have actually witnessed the sprinklers on to water the grass. There is a dying tree and large bush that needs to be trimmed but I guess that is not the City grass cutters department?I know others have complained about Spence St and our bay. Every time my tax notice comes I want to send a picture of our terrible roads and I wonder why my taxes are not being applied to my street in my neighbourhood?

In the past, someone from the city has reminded members of the community playing cricket on the school black-top to refrain from doing so. I am not sure what personnel came out to do this, but it would be most helpful if they could assist us again. We ask that they use the baseball diamond and not the playground area for the following reasons - it is ruining a patch of grass by the school, it has caused a window to be broken in the past, and it impedes members of the community from playing basketball in the area, which is what it was intended for in the first place. We will also request our security company for the school division to assist, but if you have personnel that can help in any way, it would be most appreciated.

My name is Roman and I live with my family next to Maple Leaf Park. My children go to play on this playground every day and I would like to point out one problem that has appeared quite recently. Initially, the site was lined with sawdust, and this solution was not ideal, but it was acceptable. However, a week or two ago, the coating was replaced with fresh sawdust. It would seem that everything is fine, but the new sawdust is not sawdust, but real huge chips. Since our playground was lined with this fresh coating, we have taken splinters from different places on the bodies of our children more than once. I am attaching a few photos to make it clear what I mean. I hope for your help in solving this not difficult, but important problem for us. Thanks in advance. P.S.

The departments are asked to respond directly toSR_Admin@regina.ca with the information required so that a coordinated response can be sent to the resident from Service Regina. Service Regina will ensure the noted Council members are copied on the coordinated response.SR 2089487 forwarded to Regina City Police for responseSR 2089488 forwarded to Parks Maintenance for responseHi Lori,Thanks for your callback on July 15, 2021 regarding safety and noise concerns on Crosbie Crescent. As requested, here?s an overview of the issues we chatted about, plus some background information for anyone not familiar with the area.Crosbie Park (?Pirate Park?) is located in the centre of Crosbie Crescent in Eastbrook. It has a Pirate themed kids playground in the centre, as well as a single-net paved basketball court in the NW corner. During the day, it?s a well utilized and enjoyable asset to the neighborhood; post 10PM, it often becomes a different spot altogether. Specifically, on any given day, several times per week (or night), teens and young adults will use it as an after-hours hangout spot and cause disturbances such as:?&nbsp;loud and expletive-filled conversations?&nbsp;vehicles speeding (has happened beside the park in the daytime too)?&nbsp;vehicles racing, sometimes in a follow-the-leader procession around the crescent (as many as six cars have been observed)?&nbsp;vehicles drifting (happens often near the North end of Chuka Blvd)?&nbsp;revving and popping of loud exhausts?&nbsp;anecdotally: drinking, smoking, recreational drug use, etc.?&nbsp;basketball ?practice? or games often featuring several of the above although the sound of a dribbling basketball or basketballs alone in the middle of the night can be surprisingly loud.The park is ringed by two-story homes which tends to amplify sound from the park due to the canyon effect. The majority of these homes have their main bedrooms facing towards the park. On a hot night many will open their bedroom windows for comfort or reduced A/C usage only to be inundated with noise. We?ve been living on Crosbie Crescent since late 2019 and these nuisance issues have grown exponentially since then. On behalf of everyone?s safety and sanity who lives or visits here, I would be grateful for any help that you, the city, and the police can offer in reducing these problems.Some suggestions:?&nbsp;install noticeable signage near playground equipment benches / basetball court showing park hours as it relates to the noise bylaw.?&nbsp;random police drive bys around the park between peak problem hours of 11PM and 3AM.?&nbsp;police chats with anyone found in the park after hours to explain park usage and noise bylaw (points to sign;)?&nbsp;occasional unmarked police vehicles parked along Crosbie Crescent, George Street, or Chuka Blvd North from late evening through early morning hours will catch frequent dangerous drivers in the act.On a related side safety note, the basketball court was obviously designed by someone who has never seen a cliche driver training video. The hoop is in the far NW corner of the park and every ball that misses the backboard immediately goes bouncing into the street. The ball either hits a parked car or more dangerously, kids chase it right into the street from in-between said parked cars. In effect, it?s a blind corner and a disaster waiting to happen. If it can?t be physically reconfigured, at the very least, some sort of backstop should be installed to stop errant balls i.e. a fence or a sand trap.Thanks again for your help with this matter. If you or anyone else needs further information from me, don?t hesitate to ask.Regards,Trevor MillerCell: 3065202345",7/20/2021 12:32,1,,,,,,

It was exciting to have it improve. We do appreciate having this done even through the 4-6 weeks turned into just over 12. The problem we have is the center of the bay. They removed the curb and took out the sidewalk, according to workers there could be no sidewalk because of the tree, which is a problem. The PROBLEM is that the tree has grown so much that it now blocks out light for half the bay causing it to be dark and uncomfortable to half the bay. So they did come and only partway filled it and now it is growing weeds and looks awful. So what we suggest is that the tree needs to be removed, level the ground and fill it with rocks. The reason for this is that the city now only comes once a year to cut and water it and has left the rest of the care to the residents. Unfortunately no one on the bay except one person is able to do the work and he is not around very often. So please inform the department that is responsible for it to make our bay look good and is environmentally friendly. There would be no further cost to the city and we would have a good looking bay.

I'm very thankful for everything that is done and look forward to seeing how we progress in the future. I have a couple small issues that I have tried on my own to have resolved however nothinghas been done. First of all there is a ""construction next to highway"" sign on the exit ramp off Lewvan going west. It was put up when the Lewvan overpass was being built and stayed there while the bypass was being built. I contacted the city and departmentof highways regarding it and no one wants to claim it. There is no construction and it can be confusing for new drivers.Next is there are a lot of blue rubber bands being tossed aside by our mail carriers. Not only is it littering but it is also a hazardto our wildlife (ducks, squirrels, birds). Again I contacted the post office regarding this a couple years ago and never received a reply. These rubber bands are all over, as well there are many by pickup boxes for the carriers. I did have a picture of onebox that had at lest 25 by it, however when I did not get a reply I gave up!The last issue, you may not be able to help. It is in the Harbour Landing area. When I walk my dog on the crushed gravel side of the creek I noticed that there is no garbage can fromwhen I go onto the path on Gordon Road till I get off the path on Harbour Landing Drive. I also like to pick up plastic bags and put them into a close garbage, however, I don't like carrying other peoples garbage that far. It is almost until I get back tothe Walmart area that there is a can!Thank you for your time and consideration into my little problems. I hope you are healthy and you have a great summer.

They were discharging the grass onto the road. Grass clippings in summer is worse then ice in the winter for motorcycles. It takes all traction away and causes serious accidents.Today at 853am I saw a bunch of grass clippings a city of Regina mower left in the intersection of University Park Dr and Arcola Ave. This would be even worse as it?s a corner and a motorcycle would have no chance.I called the City right away and demanded it get addressed and cleaned up and that the maintenance department instruct mower operators not to discharge grass clippings on streets.At 3pm the grass was still in this intersection. I will be advising the motorcycle association in Regina to watch for this and if an accident is caused because of grass clippings H-D the City will be at fault not the operator of his or her motorcycle. We pay enough to enjoy our machines and don?t need poor city maintenance to cause more harm!Darryl Haas",8/3/2021 9:01,1,0.016011934727430344,0.005928377155214548,0.0007263017469085753,0.9604402184486389,0.016503695398569107,0.000389457301935181

It is not a major leak but it is leaking enough to make a small puddle that has been there for at least 3 days now so I thought I would at least report it to the city. The leak is right beside the walking path through Reeves Park just as you cross Reeves Road heading east on the path right across from the first light standard as you enter the Park from Reeves Road.

The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Hello Tom,I am really sorry that there were problems opening Massey Pool early this year and that there have been some ongoing landscaping issues.I definitely lobbied for an early opening of Massey and Regent pools and I believe that city staff were doing everything they could to open the pool early. I agree with you that having access to our outdoor pools as long as possible on our short season is important, especially after the last year and half under COVID public health restrictions.The reasons for the delay in opening Massey pool, from what staff have told me, was because there were problems with the concrete inside walls and I understand work had to be redone. Again, this created an unfortunate delay.I have seen a number of requests from other residents about the need to improve landscaping around the pool. The responses to those concerns was that city staff are waiting until the end of the pool season to do some of this work.&nbsp; I was not aware of overgrown weeds, so thank you for alerting us to this issue. I am copying Service Regina and through this email I request that someone from our Recreational Facilities branch look into your concerns and provide an explanation for this year?s delayed opening and the plans for landscape improvements.Do take care and have a good weekend. CherylCheryl Stadnichuk (Pronouns: she, her)Councillor Ward 1City of Regina(Treaty 4 Territory and homeland of the Metis)Ph: 306-777-7175&nbsp; C: 306-552-5617E: cstadnic@regina.caHello.I wrote to you very early this year to express my concerns of having Massey Pool being a usable swimming facility over this summer. I asked you to please try to open early, ensure the grounds are well kept and the pool was able to be kept at a swimmable temperature. This should not be a hard thing to achieve. I also pointed out the issues with Regent not having enough boiler capacity to keep up last year and hoped that Massey would not be neglected the same way this year.The days were already getting shorter before Massey opened up this year. Currently the grounds have more weeds than grass and the weeds by the men's washrooms are over 3 feet high. If this were my yard, the city would have fined me. And now, over the last few days, the water is too cold to swim effectively. I was told that the boiler is working but it can't keep up with the cold nights we have been having. We live in Saskatchewan. This is not an excuse! Why was the boiler not added to or replaced?Why do we continually have to put up with this? Who is looking after the pools and why do they still have a job? Things are getting worse every year. Not better. I would like to know what action is currently being taken to address the temperature issue. If the pool is being checked every day, they should know about the issue by now and be taking steps to fix it. Why are the grounds not being looked after? The city football pitch next door is beautiful. Do the people who look after the pools actually look at them?I asked you specifically to look into these issues early in spring so we would not be experiencing the same issues every year. I also put in a service request as you suggested. This did no good either. I am curious what is being done now as nothing seems to have been done up to this point. I was hoping that you, being a swimmer, would have had a little more concern over this issue. I am looking forward to your reply.Very disappointed,Tom Hoogeveen - thoogylives@hotmail.com&nbsp;",8/17/2021 8:01,1,,,,,,

This request was about dealing with the safety issue of cyclists not dismounting on the pedestrian bridge in A.E. Wilson, between Dorothy &amp; Ritter and the community garden. Cheryl?s concern is that there are often pedestrians on the bridge, enjoying the wildlife in the creek, and many of them are children. I agree with Cheryl that this is safety concern there. Cheryl and I would like to know what can be done to better emphasize the need for cyclists to dismount on that bridge. Cheryl was wondering if we could use additional signage or stenciling on the path. She was also thinking it might be helpful to re-paint the posts at the ends of the bridge. I would also like to know if the need for pedestrians to dismount on pedestrian bridges is currently reflected in our bylaws, so is not following the signage an offence that could be ticketed?&nbsp;I would also like to be included in your response to Cheryl.

The weeds or cattails in the water are totally over grown and when I moved here 3 years ago they were cut down and then we all could see the ducks, etc. I don?t see anything now, I hear them but it sure would be nice to see them all again, it looks weird in such a nice area to have over grown weed in the water and also no wildlife to enjoy. Also I am in the Gilroy condos on Harbour Landing Drive and there is a city fence that is separating the property from the walking trail area, near the pedestrian cross walk on Gordon Road, recently there have been some advertising signs pinned on the fence and am wondering why? It sure wouldn?t look good with the fence all filled up with advertising signs.So, just giving my opinions and wondering why the cattails are being left and not dredged out??

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Hello, Cheryl. I am a property owner near Kinsmen Park South and use the park on a daily basis to walk with my family. I am concerned about public vehicles using the gravel path/road, since this is a risk to the safety of people out walking/biking/playing. For instance, on a weekly basis, there are at least 15 cars parked along the NW-SE path. This is a group of rugby players that, when finished their practice, all speed down the road to get back to Queen Street (not sure that they even have a permit). I even witnessed a person drive through the grass the other day, after having gained access through the open gate at Queen St. This morning, I noticed tire tracks and garbage all over in the ?parking area? by the bathrooms near the water park/spray pad. This is also probably due to someone using the open gates to enter the park with their vehicle, albeit at night.I notice that all of the gates (Queen St; Lakeview Ave; Kings Rd) are left open at all hours of the day. I would like for them to be closed so that public vehicles can no longer access this gravel path and it be left to city service vehicles only. I would also like for there to be signage to relay the message that it is a not for public vehicle use/has restricted access. If this is not the case, I would like for a review of the parks &amp; open space bylaw or an update to the policies regarding Kinsmen Park in particular. It is only a matter of time until someone gets injured. There are children and dogs running around who are most at risk. I would appreciate a prompt response to my concern.

I would assume these mud holes are being fed continuously by a leaking water line. One is located near the west side fence in the so-called protected area where the dogs can come and go as they wish The other problem is near the east side entrance in front of the bench.

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Hi Andrea, Thanks for your email! I?m copying Service Regina who can forward your request to the appropriate department for action. I?m not sure if the same department responsible for easements manages gates. I was not aware of that incident. I can?t imagine why someone would crash the gate. Service Regina, I would like to be copied on the response to Andrea. Thank you and have a great day. CherylHi Cheryl, hope all is well! I'm writing in regards to the easement at the end of 25th Avenue on Bell Street (at the T intersection). I am wondering if you know or can find out if there are plans to fix and/or replace the gate at the entrance of the easement? On June 16th, there was a woman who smashed through the gate with her car and drove the length of it before crashing at the other end. My husband was the one who called the police about this and was at the scene so I can testify that this actually happened. Following this, there has been a significant amount of construction in the easement. As such, the gate was never repaired. Due to all the construction in the easement most of the grass has been worn down and it looks like a through road now. It is frequently used as a through road by residents. It has become quite unsafe to walk or ride your bike in. There is usually just a chain or a piece of do not cross plastic tape going across the entrance to the easement. We live very close to this easement and enjoy using it.

SR 2111778 to Gravel AlleySR 2111858 to ForestrySR 2111859 to Parks Dear Mayor Sanders, My husband took me to the hospital at 8:30 this morning, city trucks were parked on 400 block Argyle St.N. From 7:30 - After 11:00 supposedly waiting for a grader. The workers are sitting with trucks running. What a waste of fuel and man hours just sitting doing nothing. The grader operator should call for the trucks when he needs them. My husband and I walk this area everyday and see this happening all the time. The catwalks in this area are disgusting. We saw 2 city workers trimming trees in the catwalk across from Thom Collegiate and leave twigs and lots of glass on the sidewalk. They left the mess and didn?t pick up the glass. Also the park on Lawson st. trimmed the shrubs down to nothing but can?t bother to pick up the debris they created. The sand where children play have acorns and sticks in it. Very unsafe for children. We also witnessed 3 city work trucks parked to do a curb box. It?s no wonder why our taxes have to go up with the wasted time and fuel costs of these big trucks running for nothing. There needs to be some kind of system in place to check that the work is being done in a timely and acceptable manner. The last time I put a complaint with the city. There were repercussions for our home. The grader in winter would leave a big pile of snow at end of our driveway instead of putting the blade down to take it away. We have a 4 wheel drive so could get over the pile. Also scraped our boulevard and peeled part of the earth up and ruined the grass I planted.

He says someone else has been allowed to.Can you please confirm whether Kenton can run historical cemetery tours on a non-profit basis? If you?re able to respond directly to Kenton, that?s great ? but please cc me on that.Best,Dan LeBlancCity Councillor, Ward 6DLeBlanc@regina.ca306.552.6932Working for you from Treaty 4 TerritoryHi Dan!I hope you're doing well. I was in the cemetery&nbsp;on Oct 30 and witnessed a tour occurring. When I asked the city cemetery about it, I was informed it was a serial killer tour.&nbsp;As you know, I've been trying to organize historical tours of the cemetery for years now. I was asked several times in October to do tours and had to turn them down. To find out a third party was doing tours of the cemetery -- and glamorizing killers at that -- is not only disrespectful to the dead but disrespectful for me and my efforts to do tours since 2017.&nbsp;Would you be able to inquire into this and see how such a thing could have happened? I've had to turn down classrooms of students because tours aren't allowed, and I've been threatened with $2000 fines on multiple occasions. I can't comprehend how something like this could be approved or allowed. If there is no punishment being dealt for what happened on Oct 30, then I think it's only fair to continue operating my tours too.&nbsp;",11/10/2021 14:56,1,0.010099593549966812,0.7666140198707581,0.002564616734161973,0.19798725843429565,0.021115800365805626,0.0016186593566089869

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Hi folks, Please see the below email from Linda. As far as I can tell, it is about the size of plaque allowable on a gravestone. Linda would like permission to place a larger one than is currently allowed. I don't have a view on this one way or the other, but ask that someone respond to Linda and cc me on the response. Best, Dan LeBlanc Dear Daniel, I hope you or the mayor can help to find out who will be reviewing and discussing increasing the size and hopefully approving this. We are going to be putting a monument up in the year 2022. We would like to put one visual suitable ceramic plaque (picture) in the middle of our monument that contains both a younger and older photo of our lives together. I understand by Riverside Memorial Park cemetery the current standard for a ceramic photo size of the 2014 old regulations for the upright monument Block 115W are 4"" x 4"" 3/4. By having two pictures fit into the 4"" x 4"" 3/4 is hard to see and is too small in this day and age and does not accommodate lower vision. And by putting two separate plaques of the younger photo and of the older photo is even worst, because then there are two separate ceramic plaques. The 5"" x 7"" 1/8 is not too much bigger than the 4"" x 4 ""3/4 and should not really pose a problem on a larger monument. It is better to have one combined old and young photo on one ceramic plaque than two separate old and young ceramic plaques on one monument. Perhaps if a person is getting a 42"" monument the ceramic plaque size can be increased. With today?s modern technology I was wondering if the ceramic plaque/picture size restriction could be lifted or enhanced to better service the monument and the people who visit their beloved to be more visually suitable and accessible to low vision clients. Rather than putting two separate ceramic plaques we would like to just put one that includes both old and young photos. Since this area is almost filled with monuments it should not pose a problem, as they are starting to fill the last row now. I was wondering if the ceramic plaque size of pictures could be increased to include at least size 5? x 7 1/8? which is an appropriate size for a 42 inch wide Monument x 28? high, in which Remco monuments could accommodate for a more visually accessible and presentable picture. Remco has already made a ceramic picture that looks visually accessible and acceptable and can be used for this 42 inch sized monument. I have seen this size in other cemeteries and am wondering why Regina does not add this size to accommodate. Thank you for looking into this matter at your earliest convenience.

Thank you Hi Lori, I called the 306.777.7000 number about my trampoline which was blown into the park during the storm and then mysteriously disappeared on Tuesday Nov 23. We had tethered the trampoline behind our fence (we back onto Ripplinger park) and had planned on having 4 strong boys come to hoist it over the fence, but it was removed before we had a chance. My son is autistic and uses the trampoline during the winter months. We would like it back. Although the city claims there was no removal on that day, my neighbour saw city crews confiscate it last Tuesday November 23 at 6am by the snow plow crew that clears the pathways. Could you put me in touch with someone who can help. I'm not having any luck at the 777.7000 number.

Crossing Arcola is challenging at the best of times. With the pedestrian underpass closed, its even more problematic. Essentiallythe only options are crossing at Prince of Wales, Doan or University Park Drive. Besides the traffic, the lights are short, sometimes the road slippery, and at most times of the day, I wouldn't attempt it at University Park Drive if you paid me to.&nbsp;This time of year, only some paths are cleared, reducing not only the usable paths but also where Arcola can reasonably be crossed as it pretty much eliminates Prince of Wales as an option. And if I'm not likely to cross at University Park Dr in the summer,I'm sure as heck not going to in the winter. :-) The pathways map on the website doesn't even indicate many of the paths I walk For ease of description, assume roads all run N or S, E or W, rather than on some other angle. There is a path along the north side of Arcola, from Doan to Prince of Wales. On Princeof Wales, there is a path on both sides of the street. The east side path runs all the way from Canadian Tire to the south end of Prince of Wales, actually ending at what looks like a city parks equipment storage facility. The path on the West side of Princeof Wales runs all the way from Truesdale to Assiniboia. &nbsp;Those paths are groomed and graveled regularly in the summer, so are clearly part of the system, but never maintained at all in the winter. I understand that there're not paved so the equipment used isn't appropriate or won't always fit, but mowers and trimmersand whatever is used to lay and compact the gravel fits, so perhaps there is a way to clear snow.&nbsp;A number of people I've encountered while walking have expressed similar concerns.&nbsp;A few questions - do you know how long the underpass will be closed? I have to comment: there were signs almost all summer indicating it was, but seldom was anyone doing anything anywhere even near it and the signs remained long after the work was done on theother side of the street.&nbsp;Is there a chance that some of those other pathways could be maintained in the winter, if not regularly at least while the underpass is closed? it would not only provide more walking paths, but make crossing at Prince of Wales a logical option. rather thanforcing people back to Doan. &nbsp;And from a much longer range perspective: is there any consideration being given to someday paving some of those paths and is there any plan being considered for another pedestrian over or underpass sometime in the future, perhaps at Prince of Wales?&nbsp;Thanks for your time ?",12/29/2021 10:42,1,,,,,,

His house backs onto the school yard of Grant Road school and Mike Badham park, and there is a sidewalk on the easement that goes between his and hisneighbour?s house from Durham to the school yard and park. 1.Can the city clear snow off the sidewalk on the easement beside his house? Mr. Goodsman said that he clears the snow on his own property, the sidewalk and on the easement beside his house. He saidthat the city never clears the snow on the sidewalk of this easement, yet he has seen city workers clearing the sidewalk in Mike Badham park nearby. I said that I did not know if it was indeed the city that cleared the snow on the sidewalk in Mike Badham parkand the school yard, but that I would ask about whose responsibility snow clearing is. He said the sidewalk on the easement is used a lot especially by students who are dropped off by parents by this easement instead of in front of the school.2.Can the city regularly cut the grass along the easement beside his house? Similar to the complaint above, Mr. Goodsman said he has taken responsibility for cutting the grass on the easement even thoughit is not his responsibility. He would like the city to do this on a regular basis. 3.Lighting behind the easement at the park. Mr. Goodsman said that in the summer youth hang out in the back of the easement as it joins with the park space. He said there is no lighting back there andkids have painted graffiti on his and his neighbour?s back fences. He also believes they are smoking pot there because of the shield of darkness. He is wondering if lighting can be put in this area of the park.4.Graffiti on fences. As mentioned above, Mr. Goodsman is upset with the graffiti. He does not know if lighting would deter youth from marking his and his neighbour?s fences, but would like some kindof action. I mentioned to him that when people have art painted on fences, garages or other buildings, this often prevents graffiti.

It was scraped off Saturday, Jan 22/22 but the job they did was very pathetic. I have pictures of the job they did. The residentsof the area could not even consider using the ice with the snow piles that were left on the ice. Not sure what the flooding cycle is supposed to be but I would say it hasn't been flooded in weeks. I went out and shoveled it off so our kids can get out andenjoy it. I don't mind pitching in and making sure it's decent but every time the city does their job it's becoming clear they don't care and pretty soon there will be no point of having this option in the area. We have seen the city come and plow it a fewtimes a week but they leave without flooding it. Last week when they plowed it they pushed all the snow across the field and left it in front of our little hill. Now the kids can not use the hill to toboggan.

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Good Morning, I wanted to let you all know that I appreciate very much the work the city has done to keep city streets cleared of snow this winter. As a year round cyclist I also appreciate the work city crews do at keeping the Devonianwalking/cycle path cleared of snow. However, snow that accumulates under bridges never gets removed on a regular basis meaning that walkers and cyclists are forced to muck their way through all amounts of accumulated snow, creating their own paths. I don'tunderstand the policy of not attending to snow accumulating under bridges. Additionally, crusher dust paths that connect city sidewalks to the pathways are never cleared and access to the walking/cycle path from city arteries means heavy slugging through accumulated snow for both walkers and cyclists. I have a few suggestions that would possibly relieve the bridge underpass blockages and would like to discuss any of these with you. a. Currently, paths are cleared with city owned 1/2 ton trucks equipped with front blades. They are too big to fit under bridges. I suggest 1/4 ton trucks be equipped with blades . 1/4 ton trucks would fit under bridges. b. city equipped 1/2 ton trucks carry snow blowers and the truck bed be fitted with ramps to allow the snow blowers to be unloaded with ease from the back of the trucks. c. city owned articulated sidewalk cleaners be made responsible for underpass snow clearing. They are the right size to fit under bridges. d. In some cases sidewalk widths can be expanded to allow 1/2 trucks to pass underneath. For example Wascana Creek and Lewvan Drive underpass, which has been snow bound for over two weeks now, could be easily expanded to allow 1/2 ton trucks to fit along thepath. e. contractors , equipped with skid steer loaders , could be hired to clean under bridges after each snow event. The following video link shows how the city of Oulu, Finland approaches cycle/walker path winter maintenance. The conclusion is that if you build/clear it, they will come. ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhx-26GfCBU I have appreciated the steps council has undertaken in recent years to make our city more walker and cyclist friendly. Thank you! It has not gone unnoticed. I would love our city to build on this dynamic process and make underpasses passable during our winter months. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you Dave Hall https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhx-26GfCBU",1/25/2022 10:10,1,,,,,,

And the access to the trail coming off Krauss and Brunskill is an obstacle course, where it has been safely cleared in previous winters.Thanking you in advance,Jan Schmidt",2/3/2022 13:57,1,0.27916219830513,0.6632307171821594,0.004251190461218357,0.04511154815554619,0.00629707844927907,0.0019473097054287791

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.I am a 75 year old citizen and love walking daily weather permitting. So now that we as citizens have to clear our sidewalks within 48 hrs. of a snow fall which I do not have a problem with and mine are done properly. My question is why aren't our walkways in the parks cleared within that time limit. I was out today and they still haven't been cleaned. Also this winters service has been sketchy at best on the job left behind. If your doing a job than do it properly. my tax dollars are paying the employees so lets do our jobs properly. Thank You.

This is a high traffic area for pedestrians - going to school, catching the bus, exercise. i don't understand why it does receiveregular snow removal attention. i I have also asked that the snow be cleared going by the benches and play structure. it was done a couple times last year. again it is a high pedestrian traffic area. i shouldn't have to make a request everytime snow should be cleared or have someone to explainto me why snow removal is hit or miss.

The city requires its citizens to remove snow from the city sidewalk within a reasonable time frame it would be nice to have the same rule apply to the pathway.

Andrew Good morning Councillor Stevens, I was recently sent over a copy of The Cemeteries Bylaw No. 2008-27 Proposed Amendments 2022/2023/2024. I have attached it as a reference.

This language will be consistent with our Cemetery Tours and Event Policy currently being developed."" I own the company Regina Cemetery Tours, and I've been trying to do tours of the cemetery for about five years now. I am very concerned that this revision will put an end to my business, as the city has been noncompliant with my requests for a contract. I am under the belief that a public space like the cemetery should be open for usage by whomever, with regular operating hours. I have even offered to donate all the money from the tours back to cemetery refurbishment, and my requests have gone unanswered. I realize the cemetery isn't part of your ward, but I am not sure who I can talk to to express my concerns about these revisions.

The sidewalk snow plow had some challenges.  Even the side walk version of the snow thrower had its challenges as well.  I took photos and some video of both and we really admired the snow thrower operator who persevered equipment problems (frozen snow chute) and snow volumes!To Our Parks Maintenance folk, it was great to see the park walkways kept open through-out the winter.  Amazing on how many folks (&amp; puppies, big &amp; small, use these walkways here).  I?m sure all would be pleased to say a BIG thank you!Something we noticed, at the start, is that one department is very careful not to overlap into another department?s jurisdiction.  Thankfully this changed towards the end.  It was good to see a cooperative effort to get the job done really well!Wishing all of you a Happy Spring and Summer!Kaz &amp; Mary Herod on behalf of our neighbourhood",3/28/2022 11:54,1,,,,,,

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Perhaps you can provide answer or direct my question as follows. In Skyview between address 6121 and 6201 there is a concrete walkway that extends south off Koep Ave to the easement which runs east-west between Skyview and Lakewood. the walkway is not useful because at the end of the Skyview property there is a deep drainage ditch that currently is full of water and therefore a person cannot access the easement or visa versa. Perhaps a small walkway bridge could be installed so that the either area is accessible??

The problem is re-occurring. I believe it is due to an elevation problem with the easement that is adjacent to the property. There is a significant elevation difference between 2802 property and the city owned easement. I would consider this to be a potential design error at time of subdivision development. I suspect something the City would have approved. Further, the developer did not build a proper retaining wall which is a major contributing factor to the fence problem. Another contributing factor is the easement elevation in comparison to the street and pipeline ROW. It is much too low. Every time there is measurable rainfall and from spring melt, the easement floods (up to 4"" or 5"" deep) for most of its length. This regular saturation of the earth in this area is a major contributor to the movement of the soil on 2802 Partridge, along the easement, and the earth that the fence stands on.What it comes down to is, I am kindly requesting that a person from the appropriate department call me to discuss the situation. We are tired of putting time and money into correcting the fence problem only to watch the problem to return. We firmly believe that this problem was created by the significant elevation difference and the very regular flooding.

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Hello Councillor Stevens, I am a Ward 3 resident who lives adjacent to Maple Leaf Park. I own a townhouse condo (Maple Leaf Estates I) that faces the park on the West side. I am writing to inquire about the walking path that runs north-south along the west side of the park (I have included an image below for reference: red line is the path). Within the park, there are several paved pathways, but they are all toward the east side of the park (near the pool and playground). The west path is gravel. Due to the location of my home, I have the opportunity to witness many residents of the city using this walking path all throughout the year. That said, I have some concerns which I hope could be addressed by you and/or council (if not already something in the works! The path is heavily trafficked; it provides a route for students to Thomson school to the north, and for high school students commuting south to Miller &amp; Balfour. Many others use the path for commuting, cycling, and leisure. That said, I have some concerns! The path in question has not been maintained or cleared by city workers to my knowledge (the paved pathways, however, are cleared). Over this past winter, I observed as the path became quite hazardous to navigate due to buildup of ice and snow - I myself slipped and fell a few times while walking on it. The spring thaw leads to the path becoming difficult to traverse due to muddy/wet conditions. As of today, the path is quite walkable, but I worry about the same issues occurring again in the future. I was hoping you could let me know of any plans in place to improve the conditions of this path. I feel that having this pathway paved and maintained year-round would be a worthwhile change in the community. I am aware of plans to improve the east-west corridor for bike lanes/walking paths in the city, but was hoping this stretch of path does not fall under the radar in improving our neighborhood. (It would even be good in the short term to re-coat the path with stones/gravel since anytime it is wet, the path turns to mud.) I am more than happy to talk or meet with you in person to discuss further - I would be happy to show you my concerns in person at the park. Please don't hesitate to reply or reach me by phone (in signature below) Sincerely, Lukas Miller",5/5/2022 13:57,1,,,,,,

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Councillor Hawkins, I resubmitted my request to the city below as I never received an answer from you or them. I?d be happy to patrol my neighborhood and report the dozens of homes that neglect their yards. I would like to discuss this possibility so maybe I could help become part of the solution to this ongoing problem! Thank you, Dorothy Desharnais I submitted a service request last week and no one bothered to get back to me. (A rough draft is below). So it was obvious they came back the next day and put the street cleaning signs on the barricades and I must commend the city for this very effective strategy, as I didn?t see any cars left on the street(for the first time ever) and did see the Parking Enforcement Officer and a tow truck! Nevertheless, my request has obviously been ignored as no one bothered to even acknowledge they received my request. And the most urgent question of the dandelions on the boulevard is being ignored. Are they going to be sprayed at the very least? I'd appreciate an answer. My taxes keep going up every single year and the city had the gall to quit taking care of the boulevards so now all the lawns are infested by dandelions!! Like I said before - a large number of Harbour Landing owners don?t care about their yards let alone the boulevards. I?m sure the city was aware of this fact when they dropped the care of our boulevards. These homeowners should be fined $200 to be paid within two weeks. They?d smarten up real quick!! The slow process of reporting, then sending letters out, plus weeks before they have to cut their lawn is ridiculous! There is a million dollar home a block away that has been there for years and still has a dirt front yard. And the city will not make them put a lawn in? Why not? Please let me know you received this request Thank you! Dorothy Desharnais Message sent to City Last Week I live at 5414 Jim Cairns Blvd and was just wondering why the city has those orange barricades on the boulevards on both sides of the street. I imagine they will be doing something to the boulevards and I?d like to know what it is. In Harbour Landing no one maintaining the boulevards have been an issue for the past few years. The city used to take care of them but discontinued to (which in itself is disappointing as our taxes are raised every single year - 9 years now) Apparently it became the homeowners duty although we were never notified to do so. Also a huge problem in Harbour Landing has been, and I imagine still is, homeowners not taking care of their front or back yards at all - let alone the boulevards! We of course did cut and water our boulevard but hardly anybody else did so they became full of dandelions which made it impossible to keep our lawn dandelion free, Our whole neighborhood was full of them. So we would appreciate knowing what the city has planned for the boulevards and hope this will help our neighbourhood look somewhat respectable! Thank you!",5/12/2022 8:27,1,,,,,,

I have lived in the Westerra subdivision since 2019. When I moved here the grass along the walking paths looked beautiful. The grass died in the common areas in the summer 2020. This happened shortly after Forster Harvard Development handed over responsibility of the maintenance to the city. The city has taken 2 years to fix this issue. In the spring of 2022 and without communication the city has started with repairing this area. The problem is that the city has done substandard work of not properly spreading the seed throughout the area. It is evident just looking at the area that seed was applied improperly. Most of the large area has zero to little seed spread. Some areas have heavy spread seed and there is no consistency whatsoever. We are also unsure why the workers left the original weeds, rather then removing them when putting down the seed. This area is right across from my house. My house is my investment and this is insulting that we are paying taxes comparable to Harbour Landing, considering the cities inability to maintain common areas along walking paths",5/30/2022 18:12,1,0.010423226282000542,0.08511345088481903,0.004132515750825405,0.887642502784729,0.010803690180182457,0.0018845743034034967

My understanding is that there is a bylaw prohibiting the use of two driveways on one side of a property? (If you could help me find this bylaw that would be great so I can read the details) There are a number of reasons why I think an exemption to the bylaw in this case is appropriate.My other question is in regard to my boulevard strip in front of my house. I am perfectly OK with their responsibility that the city gives homeowners in tending this strip of grass. I have actually worked very hard at my boulevard in the last couple years. However I am not OK with the city killing my grass every year! The particular challenge for me is that I have a bus stop in front of my house, and that the city clears extra space for the bus stop - dumping heaps of extra snow (and perhaps salt/sand as well) on my boulevard lawn. The last two years I have spent hours of time and labor, gallons and gallons of water, as well as seed and fertilizer on growing some of the best grass on all of grant road - and Both years the city has succeeded in killing my beautiful grass! This is depressing and very disappointing. Although I consider myself a patriot of Saskatchewan, I do not appreciate the city turning my Boulevard lawn into a Saskatchewan flag each year - Half yellow half green! (Lol? that?s not too far of an exaggeration? if you email me back I will send you a picture!) Here is my request - I would really appreciate if the city would put 2-3 rows of sod in my Boulevard strip - as it would have a much better chance of surviving all the salt and snow that gets dumped on it every year. This should be done in the next month or two, or next spring, so the grass can take root and have the best chance of surviving. Please remember that this is not my property - it?s the city?s property. I have invested way more than my fair share of work, time, and money into taking care of The cities property- and the city keeps ruining my work. I feel it?s only fair for the city todo their fair share. Please reach out to me and let me know if my request as possible. Thank you for your time, Jonathan Danyluk",5/31/2022 8:48,1,,,,,,

The workers threw down grass seed, which doesn?t adequately cover anything. There are many spots they missed and thework probably would be better if down by children. It seems as if no one is holding them accountable for this work. They didn?t remove the weeds first and the seed was not done evenly. They were supposed to be using a hydroseed, but the seed they put downlooks like regular seed. Why were there no signs informing residents to stay off the seeded area? Zero communication that this project was taking place. I am very upset with the sloppy work your city crews are performing. This is in the easements along wheatst, between Canolla ave and flax ave.

I?m a long time resident of Uplands and take my dogs to the new dog park in the Mount Pleasant dog park every morning. I love the dog park, it?s great. This morning I went with my two dogs as usual and noticed that there were some City workers weed wacking both inside and outside of the fenced compound. We went in the front gates and I let my dogs free. We made the loop almost all the way around until we got to the east side of the park. There were several city workers weed wacking at the fence and a we got closer I realized they had the fence wide open. My dogs beelined it and escaped. The city worker closest to the gate saw them coming and just stood there and smiled. I was too far away to even try to catch up. My two large dogs were now loose. This is a danger for a number of reasons. My dogs could have attacked another dog or person and hurt them. They could have run out into traffic and been killed. It took me an hour to chase after them and finally get them leashed. As you can imagine, I was not impressed. If an incident had occurred, I would have held the city liable and taken legal action. This is not an acceptable way to conduct work in and around a compound directly built to contain potentially dangerous if loose animals. To prevent future incidents, I propose that either A: signage is put up at both entrances, alerting dog owners that the gates are open so that they DO NOT let their dogs off leash. Or B: inform workers that the gates of any off leash dog park under maintenance should remain CLOSED at all times to prevent dangerous incidents from occurring. I appreciate your time to read this letter and I hope you will take actions to prevent any further situations from occurring.",6/2/2022 9:39,1,0.006099781021475792,0.06504806876182556,0.003496426623314619,0.750333845615387,0.13656146824359894,0.038460299372673035

Please copy the Councillor in your response to the resident:Dear Councillor Hawkins, I am not sure if you recall our interactions of 2020 regarding maintenance of the ER along the storm channel in Harbour Landing, as well as the green space along homeowners? fences. I have been contacted by some HL residents asking if I was aware of any changes taking place this year regarding maintenance of these spaces. As well, I was asked if I would make the initial contact with you. (I have reluctantly agreed to do so.) As you are aware, last year saw a significant improvement to the green space along the storm channel and along homeowners? fences. It was great and we were all very happy that you and the City followed-through with the commitment you made to the residents of HL. That being said, it now looks like the City Parks Dept is reverting back to letting these green spaces go back to long, weed-infested grasses, which are unusable by homeowners, their children and pets. The space behind homeowners? fences have also been left unkept and uncut. We all noticed some City workers cutting some grass recently and it was very sporadic with much of the space uncut (which is not what was promised to us in 2020). A prime example would be to walk on the paths along the storm channel between Gordon Road and going South towards James Hill Road. It it hideous. I have committed to getting back to some of the residents once I hear back from you. Thank you and looking forwarding to hearing from you.

Last night my family and I were out for a walk in Kinsmen Park South and had move off the path as cars headed towards us. There were many cars using the walking path to drive on and then park for an event. This is due to the gate being left unlocked on the west side from the entrance at Queen St. I can't imagine that this is allowed and if it is, it definitely shouldn't be. My children shouldn't have to dodge out of the way of a car on a park path, and is a danger to everyone using these parks to have fun and leisure time. I'm hoping in the future that these gates will remain locked when the city is not using them for park maintenance and/or signs can be added to this entrance stating that vehicles are not allowed down this path.

There was no clean up of the leaves in the back corner and the sidewalk in front and the walkway were not swept or cleaned up in any way. There does not appear to be any work done to the trees to clean them up.As for the work that was done along the neighbors fence, we did not put in a request for that to be done but it was also done very poorly.We have had ongoing issues with this neighbor re: the walkway maintenance (it is well documented by many Supervisors and/or Managers throughwritten correspondence or those who have come by to discuss), so I am not requesting that work be cleaned up.But I am requesting that this green space (by 2902 Lacon St) be cleaned up well.

He introduced himself as the team lead and it looked like he was doing some trainingfor what I assumed was the seasonal team. What is most impressive was that when I mentioned there were several trees by the childrens play structure that had significant dead branches. He first indicated he would check them out. I mentioned I would send a service request (based what a different cityemployee advised me to do a week earlier when he was doing work in the area. Tim said that was not necessary as he was going to check it out with his team and would pass the information along accordingly. He advised that some branches were very high and would require the ""Forestry team. He did not brush me off and took extra time toexplain what his team does in the park vs the other teams.

It is in behind homes on Laird Cres. It must be at least 12-18 inches tall in places. I keep the service alley beside my house cut or it would look like **** by now, like the back does. 2-3 times a summer is all we are asking for. Kids can't even play out there like I did when I was a kid. Have this same problem every year for about the last 10 years. They cut beside the handicap home on Sherwood drive and then they stop when they get to the first of trees, just south of where I live. They cut on the other side of the channel but not this side.

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Recently visited the Regina Cemetery on 4th &amp; Broad St. to visit my grandparents and a few other relatives. My cousin (from Kelowna) and I were appalled at the deplorable condition of the grounds. I was told years ago that these sites would receive perpetual care. City bylaw advises that there is care and maintenance provided. Neither of which is evident. There is no water service so very difficult to water grass if there is any grass. Gopher holes are abundant and large. I was advised the City opted out of replacing any water lines back in the 80?s and 90?s and there are no funds to do any repairs. Other than up righting fallen headstones. As the Alderwoman for my Ward and Councillor for the Ward the cemetery is located in I would like to discuss this issue. It is disgraceful the City has allowed this cemetery to become what almost looks like a war zone. How disrespectful to those people buried there and their families. I?m emotional and disgusted and need to have this issue addressed. I?m am available to discuss at any time.

The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.*Photos attached*Additional SR sent to City Manager working-together@live.comSandra, your decision to continue fertilizing dandelions in the green spaces we taxpayers pay dearly for is clearly not the best decision. As you can see from the attached pics, just 4 days ago, we paid your employees to mow and fertilize the dandelions around the lake behind the N.W. Leisure center. It takes little intelligence to realize and know that a natural method for controlling these dandelions would be a much better solution than what was witnessed this past week....seeing them mowed, then fertilized. The attached pics will be provided to social media to publicly show your poor decision to "" keep natural"" the green space. However, anybody with some intelligence, including yourself, clearly knows that your policy of ""keeping it natural "" is simply just a policy invented to charge taxpayers for ""maintaining"" by doing nothing, but charging for it.I've been accumulating videos of City of Regina employees, under your management, waisting so much of taxpayer's money, while doing "" less than acceptable "" work.....some even sleeping or texting . Others texting or on phone while moving concrete off a shoot...""one-handed"". I've even videod one job where 8 (eight) employees were standing around, while 2(two) employees were pulling concrete off a concrete truck shoot with their hands...not a shovel was in site. Even worse, 4 city vehicles were idling and being tied uo for, what would take only two private employees to do. Some white hats and some blue hats, along with yellow hats...all standing around, watching 2 staff pull concrete off a truck with their hands. Talk about wasted tax dollars.... I've worked in concrete, worked for the City of Regina, as well as other public utilities and also have an accounting background. So, I know what mismanagement and misspending is.

My husband and I live in The Creeks and back the SaskPower building and side the SaskPower emergency access lane. I contacted you awhile back about it being a dog run and thank you for taking immediate action as it really did help,however, it has unfortunately become a problem again. We are wondering if there could be signage posted in that access lane, just like they have on Wascana View Drive where it says No Trespassing or something similar. To make matters worse, we had an incidentlast week where three men in a vehicle pulled up close against our fence, stopped their vehicle, and proceeded to use drugs. They urinated on our fence and our neighbours fence. We eventually contacted the police and they waited for them to exit the lane andthen pulled them over. It was really scary. Yesterday, the maintenance man mowed the back lanes that were filled with dandelions and the debris flew over our fence and filled our yard and patio where we were sitting enjoying a nice Sunday afternoon. He hadtaken off the mower bag to get it done faster and it was on when he mowed inside SaskPower's property. My husband is in his 70's and I'm in my 60's and we are so proud of our home and don't want to move. We pay over $6k in taxes and can't believe this is happeningin our neighbourhood.

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Dear Ms. Stadnichuk; I am writing about Caen Park. This morning a Parks Dept. summer staffer weed-whacked right through the bark of several of our small trees. This kills the tree. She completely cut through a little tree several neighbors planted to replace one of the many dead trees in the park. I don't really blame her. Obviously she received no training. This neighborhood donated money towards the trees. We want all the dead trees replaced and all the small trees caged with wire cages, which will protect against both rodents and Parks staff. This is just stupid. According to my records, the neighborhood asked for trees in the park for 50 (yes, fifty) years before we finally got some. Now, half are dead, mostly at the hands of the Parks Dept. Please see that cages are put around the remaining trees immediately. I wish I could make you understand how angry and upset we all are, but I guess that's what elections are for - we have been asking for wire cages for 3 years, pretty much since a year after the trees were planted and we realized Parks staff were attacking them.

They have not string trimmed around the trees adjacent to Meadow Park Cr. fence line and the bike path or mowed. The last time was more than two weeks ago. Today I noticed they have done behind the west side's and I was told the south side was done, but not well. In years past the City sent string trimmers, for around trees, Monday or Tuesday and later that day or the next day they sent the Zero Spin Lawn mowers to mow the lawn/down the weeds on a weekly basis. (It would be nice to know their present weekly schedule as rain the past couple weeks cannot be blamed for delays in weekly maintenance.). One of our residents again was out with her personal lawn mower to mow down her next door neighbor's dandelions/grass on city property. Should she keep doing City business, at her expense, pretty soon will they expect it? Unacceptable. MPECC really requires the City to maintain their property, on a weekly basis, barring unpredictable service disruptions that affects all Civic property owners City wide. The above is from a concerned resident who retired from the City not long ago. There are city parks that have no dandelions yet ours is full. We have young children playing soccer in this park as well as numerous football try outs, that can't be good for anyone who has allergies. There are areas where the large mowers can't reach that have not been cut or touched this year. I have lived in the crescent for 17 years and have never seen the park so bad and is unacceptable.

The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Previous SR 2162286I am very concerned about the area behind my home not having the lawn cut. The dandelions are taking over and the grass is not even being cut in areas. I live on Meadow Park Crescent and I have actually gone out and purchased a lawn mower because it got so bad. I am presently cutting the grass (mostly weeds) behind the six houses on the east side of our crescent. I should not have to do that. I moved here so that I would not have to cut grass or shovel snow. The mowers come to the field behind the school and do a terrible cutting job and then leave. They are leaving strips uncut and they ignore the area by the walking path and our yards. This walking path is used continuously and it is a disgrace the way the city is dealing with this situation. There are places where the mower takes one swipe of park area and then leaves the rest. I am certainly not the only one cutting behind my home trying to control the spread of weeds and the haven for bugs. Long grass promotes a haven for ticks and other bugs. The dandelion situation is out of control. Respect our parks - take care of them. We are asking that you take care of our parks.

My name is Sharon Gudereit and I am a local Kindergarten teacher and singer/songwriter/pianist. A concern about baby birds and their mothers getting ?mowed up? by a city worker was posted on Facebook by Erin Ermel in Hawkstone. I copied the post below but you can also check it out on Facebook and read the comments. This family has contacted the city for 5 years with suggestions for change and has had no luck. They are now reaching out to the public, media, and nature organizations. They can?t stand to see this devastation and the frantic helplessness of the parent birds any longer. It breaks my heart! You are a brilliant and lovely lady leading our city through positive changes, and I thought maybe bringing it to your attention might be the best way to get something done since the family has had no luck for 5 years. Surely there has to be a solution. Mankind cannot continue to kill and devastate the creatures of the earth with no thought or compassion. Thank you for considering this matter! Here is the post below: Posted on FB by Erin Ermel: ?For five years I have watched City of Regina | Municipal Government destroy the Red Wing Blackbird habitat behind our house. Every. Single. Summer. Instead of cutting the perimeter along the highway and property fences and leaving the marsh alone, they choose to ignore the birds. I am done watching this! I?m done watching these birds perch on fences, power poles and lines chirping like crazy in devastation. They are actively nesting and I?m watching horrifically while the males try and convince the females to leave but the females keep flying back in. The males are flying above the tractor desperate to save their nests and babies. Its to no avail. The tractor keeps coming. It?s sickening and heart breaking.

PULL the weeds out and STOP cutting them with a lawn mower. Garden areas in the park have weeds 2 feet tall andspreading seed.

The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.*photo attached Hello, Westerra community members are upset with the way the walking paths look in the Westerra subdivision. In 2017 this was a fully sodded area. Forster Harvard Development had the area landscaped and taken care of until the summer of 2020. The city of Regina was supposed to take over responsibility of the maintenance during that summer, however there was miscommunication and they did not know. After residents saw sod and trees dying, many filed tickets and this eventually raised awareness to the city.Unfortunately the sod and many of the trees died before the city was able to preserve them. During the 2021 year, planning took place to decide on what needed to be done with the ground cover on the sides of the walking paths. There was discussion of the city putting down pea gravel or a drought hardy seed spray, as this is an area without irrigation. The year passed and they were not able to start any work on this space until late spring 2022. This year the city came out and sprayed drought hardy seed spray onto the ground and replaced some dead trees. Unfortunately the seed did not take and since the maintenance crews failed to remove the weeds initially, they have now completely taken over the area. Please see attached photos. Residents are extremely concerned. People are having trouble selling homes. Our homes are our investments and it is disheartening to see how this ?greenspace? looks. We are paying taxes to live here and there should be an acceptable standard to how common areas in a new residential subdivision are maintained. Myself and several other residents have filed tickets with the city to complain about this area. I spoke with Mike Robinson in Parks and Recreation who advised they would send out workers with a push mower to cut the weeds. This did not solve the problem as the weeds grow back immediately. Please review the attached photos and please provide an acceptable resolution on how we can move forward with making this area look normal again. There are mass amounts of ragweed, foxtails and thistles which are harmful to people with respiratory issues. These types of weeds are also harmful to pets and children. I have asked for the city to spray or pull the weeds, but the most they have done is cut them with a push lawn more. Our city counsellor, Shanon Zachidniak does not communicate with us and does not respond. Part of the issue with weeds is due to the feilds in Westerra that are not properly maintained. Residents have filed tickets asking for the fields to be plowed on the entrance to Westerra and in behind Barley Crescent. The plow came and did the middle section on one side and left the rest untouched. We really would just like to get these community issues resolved. I am unable to sit out and enjoy my backyard with the amount of ragweed and thistles blowing around. Please help us to solve these ongoing community concerns.",7/5/2022 14:53,1,,,,,,

The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.I am sharing with permission from Erin Ermel. Myself, along with a very active birder group are outraged with this. If anything, could mowing be postponed until the babies have fledged? I'm hoping there will be a positive outcome from this, which means no more baby birds and nests are wrecked/killed. I am writing to you today, Mayor Sandra Masters, to discuss an ongoing concern I have regarding the above destruction of a habitat within our City. For over 30 years there has been a marsh-like area beside Highway 6 North that borders the community of Hawkstone. Previous to Hawkstone being built, it was farmers field and this marsh-like area was left untouched for plants and wildlife to live and grow. A few years after we built our home backing this area, to our horror, the City came and cut it all down. It?s happened every year since. Every year since, i?ve watched this same cycle of suffering and loss. I will not watch it again. This area and habitat is home to likely many birds and animals, (ducks nest here in early Spring, we?ve had geese, and also partridges all year) but I am focusing mainly on the Red Wing Blackbirds. I?ve witnessed the devastation (and their trauma while it?s happening personally) for five years straight. I cannot bare to watch another Summer of this. These birds specifically nest on or near the ground in wetland grass, reeds, cat tails etc. This site is an active nesting area all Summer. I realize there is no law or policy to protect the Red Wings, but morally this is wrong and heart breaking. Our City values itself on protection of other species and I would like to see that value follow through on all living birds and animals. These birds should not have to suffer, lose their home and be killed year after year simply because ?it looks better?. Yesterday I was horrified once again to witness the City come through with a tractor to mow it all down. The male red wings were dive bombing the tractor and desperately trying to convince the females to leave their nests in a futile attempt to save their homes and families. It was to no avail. When everything was gone they then fought desperately to save whatever remaining nest, mom or baby that did survive as they were being eaten by crows and ravens. There is absolutely zero reason why this should happen ever again. My husband and I have inquired and made complaints for five years now and it?s gotten us nowhere. I beg you to please compromise with us and designate this area as an active nesting site with a perimeter cut only. I realize that weeds can be an issue for residents bordering the fence (we are one of them) as well as visibility and safety issues along the highway. There is no reason why that can?t be cut while leaving the interior marsh intact. In fact, directly across the road on the side that borders the highway leading out of Regina, that area is never cut. How can one side with all that is living be considered necessary to destroy, yet directly across the road is not? The marsh is not full of weeds it?s full of marsh plants. You also provide mosquito control in the Spring so pests are not an issue. I have made a few posts with tags on Facebook that I invite you to view so you can see firsthand what is happening here. I know your time is valuable, but it really paints a picture. There is an initial post, posts of the aftermath and a follow-up of my husband walking the area showing all the destroyed nests. I once again kindly ask you to consider putting a stop to cutting this area once and for all. Please. Thank you.",7/6/2022 10:21,1,,,,,,

What?s even more frustrating is we spent thousands of dollars to landscape our yards and now all the foxtail and dandelion seeds blow into our yards. I will attach photos of Norseman Park behind my house (5028 Cornell Gate). Following my email l last year, the City sent a Parks Manager to my house. All he did was make excuses as to why nothing is being done to combat the weeds. Once again nothing was done to correct the problem. Myself and many of my neighbours want action.

He said for the past three years he has called the city every year to complain about a water leak and the staff only put up a barricade over the leak and never fix it. He said most of the park is not irrigated, supposedly because the irrigation system not working, and the other half of the park is always under water because of the water leak. He is also concerned that the northeast corner of the park has not been rototilled around the shrub beds. His view is that this would not be tolerated in the south east part of the city and he is frustrated that the poor condition of the park and broken irrigation system has not been addressed for over 3 years.

The grass they planted all died and there is now nothing but weeds here. There are a lot of pickup trucks from the city daily, but they never accomplish anything. The major concern here is the weeds. Our subdivision is surrounded by fields and these are not regularly maintained. The seeds blow from the fields and carry to the finished grass. It doesn?t take long for weeds to overtake the grass when the only thing they do for weeds is cut them here. At this point the entire easement is at a point where it requires a lot of work. It?s got barely any grass growing. The only thing that grows there seems to be weeds. The city needs to be ensuring that fields in the area are cut regularly without the need for residents to continually file service requests. Something will need to be done to remove the weeds from the area since the walking paths area on Wheat st looks disgusting. I don?t understand why your maintenance people would just mow weeds out which are 2 feet high, when they should be removed. On a side note, I am curious why bylaw hasn?t come out to ticket the developer and builders for having lots which are not being regularly cut? The developer owns most of the fields, but they don?t seem to keep up with regularly plowing the fields. Truthfully the feilds don?t look much different from the easement at this point.

All you see are weeds and any grass growth is minimal. This is unacceptable. These weeds are very large and go to seed in between cuttings. They are making a mess that is spreading around to others lawns. The city needs to take better care of preventing and removing weeds. Especially in areas near open fieldswhere weeds tend to spread rapidly. The crews come to water and cut the weeds, but do not ever bend down to actually pull out the weeds. This is why this is an ongoing problem. Although weeds cannot be sprayed at this point due to the ?grass? being new;the crews need to be pulling them. There is hardly any space for grass to grow with the influx in weeds all over the area. The weeds are quite large and invasive. Most are foxtails, ragweed, thistles, tall hedge mustard etc. Daytona homes is building brandnew builds that back onto this area, listed at $545,000. How will these homes sell? How is it acceptable to cut weeds short and consider this ground cover? If the city could not take care of this area, then the city should have never approved the westerraplan.

If aggressive action isn?t taken soon it will reseed itself. If short trimming control isn?t used then the foxtail might require chemical treatment to prevent it feom getting out of control. The grass is getting tall and needs trimming which would have kept the FOXTAIL from reaching the reseeding stage.

Yesterday I asked them if there are someone who takes care of the park, and they told me they are. I expressed my concern about the broken glass by the play ground where small kid play. I told them I live ""this neighborhood"" and ""my kids play here"" and that I'm really afraid innocent kids will get hurt and stab their feet. I was responded by the woman saying yeah ""we will just leave and come back"", the other personnel, a man didn't say&nbsp;anything. But I saw them left and came back with a hand held trimmer and trimmed the grass instead. I proceeded with my work that day and thought they were going to do it maybe later that day.&nbsp;However today this morning, I woke up and did my morning walk routine around the park and lo and behold the broken glass was still there. I spoke a neighbor and told me he removed some and I also did myself the bigger pieces however it is still there. This morning I called the city of Regina and spoke with a representative and told me she was going to forward my complaint to park department. Now this evening&nbsp; I came home, it's still there.&nbsp;I would like the superior of these two personnel call me at 306 881 2218 if they need more details.&nbsp;I'm really furious about the two because they just IGNORED me and my concern. I usually see city of Regina vehicle and employee just standing up by the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me who's responsibility it is to clean the park? Is it more important to trim the grass than innocent kids getting hurt? What is your priority?&nbsp;The guys don't even have to trim yesterday because the other day they did that.&nbsp;I would like to speak to the manager in charge of these 2 personnel please.&nbsp;Also can I ask who is my city representative in my area?

If my lawn looked like this I would be fined as per bylaws. There are events that happen in this park and it?s quite embarrassing that it looks like this. In past years the grass would be cut weekly and there would also be weed control. I am asking that the maintenance of these parks be improved and also more frequent. Could you please respond back to me once this has been resolved.5005 Anthony Way",7/18/2022 12:42,1,0.03811920806765556,0.6821126341819763,0.0037198455538600683,0.26317140460014343,0.008897027000784874,0.003979886416345835

The department is not required to respond however if a response is provided, ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.First off, just to warn you I'm somewhat pissed off at the state of our green spaces in Harbour Landing so I will apologize a head of time! I took my dog for a walk tonight and I have mosquito bite upon mosquito bite. The green space behind our house is absolutely filled with mosquitoes, weeds and grasshoppers. Then we went on Campbell street (the closed section from Gordon Rd to the highway) and the weeds are 3 ft. tall some grass 4 ft. tall and the mosquitoes and grasshoppers twice as bad. We used to walk behind the fence of Harbour Landing by the highway and now you can't the grass and weeds are so high! What is happening to this community??? The walking paths in the green space behind us is growing over with weeds!!!! Why aren't all the walking paths paved? Does nobody give a shit until someone like me who is ready to blow a gasket at the state of things in the area has to contact the city and tell them their job! We moved back to Regina 8 years ago and really liked the feel of the area, the green spaces, walking paths, etc.! When Wilko was looking after the green spaces you could tell the workers took pride in their work. The grass was cut and reseeded, weeds were pulled in the shrubbery area, wood chips put down to help combat weeds, now there are very few shrubbery areas as the weeds have choked out the different trees and shrubs that were growing. It was the worst thing that happened to the green spaces, the city taking over! Then you look at some yards and the weeds growing in there, this area doesn't stand a chance! Why should people have to email in to complain, you have compliance officers that should be driving around and handing out tickets! The other day at 9:30 in the morning, there were a group of 8 of what I assume were summer students, all parked in the ditch at an entrance to Harbour Landing visiting and on their cell phones! Those kids should of been assigned an area each in the parks/green spaces pulling weeds, picking up garbage etc.! Clearly there needs to be some sort of management and clear direction of what needs to be done, not just joyriding around on those machines....it's not rocket science! Then there are the building sites that are a disaster with building material and garbage thrown on the ground from the construction workers! Does there not have to be site clean up at the end of the day or I guess they can just leave their shit laying on the ground. For over two weeks there has been plywood laying across the side walk for people to walk, trip on! Maybe a call to occupational health and safety should happen and let them know that the city was contacted and did nothing! Then there is the piles of dirt and sand that is dumped on the street for weeks at a time and being washed into the sewers when it rains! Cars are driving over part of the dirt pile because it comes out so far! I stepped on nails on the sidewalk as well! I'd like to know why the other areas of the city all have paved walking paths, well manicured green spaces!!!! My husband and I were both born and raised here and were member what Glencairn was like back in the 80/90's and unfortunately that is what I see this area heading for. AND don't reply back to tell me to send in the names of the streets with some of these issues because I won't, that's not my dam job, its yours ,so do it! All I can tell you is that in a couple of years when we retire, it won't be here or in this province!",7/29/2022 8:59,1,,,,,,

The grass in the ditch on Courtney St. north of Mapleford Gate needs to be cut. I don?t understand what for years they were able to do it all in one day. Now a full size tractorshows up to cut the slope of the ditch. It usually makes one or two passes and then drives down the road (Courtney) and leaves, then the whipper snipper shows up the same day or a day or two before or after, then a day or two before or after that a ridinglawn mower shows up to cut 4 passes behind ours fences (sometime they cut to the fence and others they leave a large space behind the fence uncut). I just don?t understand why something that was done in one day for 10 years, now has changed to a 2-5 day project. Also, a sign was placed on the west side of the ditch (Corner of Courtney and Mapleford Gate - northwest corner). It says, ?A growing frenzy can be a colossoil mistake.? They cut the grass, on the corner, to place the sign but it is hypocritical to then leavethe full westside ditch overgrown with weeds and wild grass. Lastly, we have trees in the ditch behind our home (7230 Maple Way). Four of them died or their growth is very stunned because they never got any water in the spring. For these trees to survive and thrive they need some help with water. I am not willing touse my own because of the cost of water/sewer.

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response. We recently received an insert with our water bill indicating ""overgrown grass doesn't cut it"" we find this in direct contradiction to the manner in which the City of Regina takes care of the berm behind our property at 22 Wesson Bay. We have called last year and again this year, several times, to have the city crew to do weed and grass cutting in this area. So far this year they have run through the berm, seemingly at random, and made swathes through this area. Unfortunately a good portionof the area is left untouched and is now is over 2 feet high and full of weeds. (Dandelions and thistles) Your operator goes no where near our property fence - although along Gordon Road they manage to go right up to the property lines and cut ALL of the bermnot just random swathes. The one conclusion we have arrived at is that the city is only concerned about maintaining berms that can be seen easily by road traffic. The city insert's message should be heeded by the city itself.

2179375,8/4/2022 11:07,Parks Inquiry,PrkGrbEmpt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,PPMC,5001, ,JIM CAIRNS,BLVD, ,"1. Positioning of garbage bins along the pathways: In Harbor Landing there are multi-use pathways extending all the way from Highway 1A to Parliament Ave. On these pathways the garbage bins are placed next to the benches. People using these benches are forced to endure the stink emanating from these bins inaddition to being bothered by the flies and other insects infesting these bins. Also, some people throw the garbage into these bins from a distance, resulting in these falling on the benches sometimes. Hence, people, particularly senior residents, who use these paths for walking in the early mornings and late evenings and who would like to take some rest in between their walks are deterred from using these benches by the stink and the insects. Placing thegarbage bins in close proximity to the benches negates the very purpose for which these benches were installed in the first place. Could these garbage bins be relocated to at least 15- 20 feet away from the benches? It would also be beneficial if more benches are provided along the pathways. 2. Trees along the pathways: As the summers become hotter around the world, many cities around the world are increasing their tree cover to mitigate the heat and also reduce carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We in Regina should be planting more trees particularly in the new neighborhoods. I have been using the multi-use pathway in Harbor landing for a number of years now and find that there is not a single tree along these pathways. During summer, the only time that the people, particularly the elderly can use these pathways are early morningor in the late evening, around sunset. At all other times, it is very hot and tiring to walk on these pathways. I have occasionally noticed older people looking around for some shade during their walks. Hence, I suggest that the City of Regina should plant shade giving trees along these pathways, staggered at intervals of 20 feet on both sides of the pathways. Initially these can be planted on the unpaved pathways, leaving the paved ones for those who wantto walk in the sun. Planting trees that provide shade will encourage more elderly and senior people to use these pathways at all times of the day, while also helping the environment and in mitigating the effects of global warming. As mentioned earlier, providing more benches along the pathways under the trees would be very beneficial. Thank You for your consideration.

Seven year's ago we moved into the neighborhood and have thoroughly enjoyed the use of the park. The path was maintained yearly with scraping, new gravel, and weed control. Over the last 3 years this has fallen by the wayside ( understandably due to covid for 3 years). Now there has been nothing done this year. The weeds have almost completely grown across the path and the gopher holes are becoming quite dangerous. Our neighborhood demographics will show that most people around here are quite older and have high incomes. Most of which have small dogs which like to use the park on a daily basis. For 6 years I have been taking my snow blower and keeping the almost 1/2km of path clear after every snowfall, with occasional help and financial assistance from other neighbors. Last year it proved to he a monumental task with the portion along the southern fence line becoming overwhelming by the end of season. Personally, I enjoy helping out the neighborhood pet lovers but there are some things I just can't do. 1- I would like to see the path repaired with the weeds removed and fresh gravel. 2- I would ask if there is any way the city could assist with winter maintenance. Perhaps with snow fencing along the southern fence line and the occasional pass with the sidewalk snow plow after heavy winter storms? I know this is asking a lot but this has been one of Regina's more elite neighborhoods for many years. I hope that you can assist in keeping this classic neighborhood and park beautiful.Location Plainview Park on Plainview Road in Albert Park.",8/8/2022 11:42,1,0.0017994865775108337,0.004284186288714409,0.0004249314370099455,0.9896705746650696,0.003595048561692238,0.0002258606837131083

This portion is currently planted in grass. I am thinking it could be planted with some trees or shrubs similar to what is currently planted on the south west corner. We are envisioning a corridor of about 30 feet wide so as not to loose the use of the grassed area. This corridor would follow the fence line of the adjoining residential properties. We also would volunteer to maintain the planting to ensure the successful growth.1727 Clive Bay,8/8/2022 16:39,1,0.0006870832294225693,0.9958232641220093,0.0006517866277135909,0.001345873810350895,0.0004695341922342777,0.0010225079022347927

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.See previous SR 2180855 in addition to this email the Mayors Office and Councillor Bresciani received. Please Contact.We have refrained from contacting you both to this point, assuming that the best option to complete our backyard project was to work closely with the City departments responsible for execution. This morning became the tipping point, as it became obvious that following established processes and being actively engaged with the Parks department all along the way is far less effective than being a squeaky wheel that applies pressure from the top down. To provide some context and background, we have been planning to install a pool in our backyard for over a year, and have been working with Paradise Pools. They kept us informed of the permits needed, including the park access and building permits, and were applying for those on our behalf. At the end of May, we had a contractor here to start the process of preparing the yard by removing some trees. He thought the park access permit was in place already, and started to come through the park along the route that had been indicated. Our neighbour, Tyler Finch, stopped him and asked for his permit. Wanting to avoid conflict, he came to ask me about it. I tried to call the City to check the status of the park access permit and was unable, as the home owner, to get any information on the permits on my property and was given an email address with the caveat that it could take days to get a response. So we did not use the park for that work. Tyler then informed me that we do not have permits in place. It seemed very inappropriate for him to have that information about my property when I had just tried to access the same. It appears he was using contacts he had from his days of working at the City. This breech of protocol and privacy violation is clearly alarming. You can imagine our surprise when a couple hours later Jim Gordon, a building official with the City, came to our door to hand deliver a paper pool permit application. We explained we were working with Paradise and they were handling the application. Our build was not scheduled to begin for another month. When he realized no work had begun and the timelines we were working on, he also couldn?t understand how, under any normal process, he had come to find himself standing at our door. We sent an email expressing our concerns over this event on May 26, which you were copied on Lori, and have not received an adequate explanation of this departure from process or the inappropriate access to our personal information. We have owned not one, but three properties on this park. We love the park as much as anyone and have made every effort to plan and execute our project responsibly and to minimize any impact on our neighbours. When it came time to build, Kaitlin, from Paradise Pools, has been in constant communication with the City. We have had several on site meetings with the Parks department. Knowing our neighbour was concerned about the park access, we worked with the Parks staff to coordinate turning off the irrigation for a couple days prior to access to ensure the route was as dry as possible. We obtained verbal permission on the day of access. A part of the access permit process, we also came up with a plan for how to address any damage that was done. The parks manager, Amanda Timleck, had become involved at this point, as it appears our neighbour was already lodging complaints before work had even begun. To minimize damage, our contractor used a small tracked bob cat (to minimize pressure on the ground and avoid ruts) and the work was competed over 2 days. The repair plan was to aerate any tracks that were made to help the grass rebound, level and regrade in any area needed, top dress to match the grade where necessary. The City would provide the grass seed in areas where grass had been damaged to ensure in the end the repair would be seamless and the ground cover would match with the existing park grass mixture. We met this morning to inspect the area and confirm the plan for repair. Amanda had also worked with the City landscape architect to double check that the plan would meet all requirements. We spoke with Amanda at 10am this morning when she called to let me know she would not be able to make our meeting today due to illness, but that she had briefed Bill Edwards, who is the Leadman who has been working with us, and that we were good to go with our plan. When Bill showed up at 11am this morning, their department had received new instruction from City Council that the entire area that had been used for access would need to be dug out and sod installed. This was obviously a major departure from our agreed to plan, and appears to be entirely out of the ordinary for repairs. The park staff was unable to identify any other instance where sod had been required for a minor park repair. Setting aside the extreme difference in the cost of this plan over the one previously agreed to, it is our opinion it would not result in a better long term solution. It is not possible to obtain sod that would match the grass mix that is used on the park, so this would result in a strip behind our houses that would forever look different. It would not blend in and go away as the over seeding plan will within a short amount of time. We believe the plan established in partnership with the Parks staff is the one that will result in the best long term solution and in the shortest timeframe. Our contractor is ready to do the repair we planned next week, and we expect the park to recover within weeks. Trying to engage a landscape company to do an extensive sod installation at this point in the season will be challenging to say the least. It is also concerning to see the Council stepping in and overruling the decisions of City staff. From an organizational perspective, not only is it inefficient, but potentially damaging to be undermining the authority of the people who are trusted with the responsibility of these roles. It is also concerning that we, as the impacted home owners, have had absolutely no communication or insight into the processes that seem to be at work behind the official ones which we have diligently been following. How is it that Council would become so involved in a minor park repair to the point of dictating the methods and means? We are not aware of any site visit by Lori to access the impact and we have not been contacted in any way to discuss the planned repairs. We would welcome a visit from any of the Council to come have a look. We have left messages with both of you, and look forward to being able to discuss this matter soon.",8/11/2022 15:19,1,,,,,,

I appreciate you continuing taking my inquiries and shaking the tree a bit. I understand people are always busy, but it seems the default 1st level of service to an external inquiry is to completely ignore. Then hope that person forgets and then it?s an easy win. Ryley S***** on the other hand gets great kudos for actually responding promptly and trying to genuinely help.I?m not expecting an instant reply and instant action. But pushing four weeks now without even an acknowledgement from either guy Ryley forwarded my concerns to? That?s just brutal and unacceptable. As long as I continueto live in Regina and pay tax to the City of Regina, I will continue to push them to give me a minimum level of service.Therefore: 1.Can you please inquire about getting my turf and topsoil replaced in the front before the end of this season so it has time to take? It still looks like crap. Their replaced strip hasbeen half dead garbage since they put it in last fall and is definitely not as good as or better than what was there. 2.If it?s the city?s responsibility to keep the grassed easements clear, please inquire about getting our easement cleaned up. My weed whacker is good for grass edging, not chopping downthe jungle growing back there. It?s a mosquito sanctuary and noxious weed oasis. There are a few trees growing there that I never planted but I am fine with leaving those. The ?low? (5? to 6?) tall growth is what I am talking about.Thanks.You can get me on my personal cell if need be 306-529-0425. Wally Demiak P.Eng.

The city was supposed to have a team out pulling weeds and I have been watching daily and none has been pulling weeds. The area is more weeds than grass in most places and looks absolutely disgusting. The edges especially and the west side of the path are even even worse condition. The gardens at Sereda park are full of weeds and there is also increased weeds throughout sharp park. Can they please do something to control the spread of the invasive foxtails and other weeds etc. There is a section of sod which is completely missing from sharp park (cricket pitch) along the walking path. This needs to be replaced. They need to have people here pulling the weeds and making appropriate use of time. It is a waste of time to send people to water the weeds in the easement, while it is raining. I constantly see teams of people here, yet one person has a hose watering the weeds and the others are standing around drinking coffee and smoking. The easement backs onto Daytona homes property and this is a detractor in marketing this new area. Normally green-space should be seen as a positive thing, however no one wishes to back onto a field of weeds, crabgrass and dandelions. It is disgraceful that Westerra was given a landscaping award in 2018. This award should be taken away from westerra based on how the city has let this area completely go. The boulevards on Canolla ave in front of the area zoned for commercial development look horrendous. It seems like the city is not keeping up with practices to minimize the spread of weeds from the fields. The area is progressively looking worse as time goes on. Cutting weeds is not minimizing the spread, since adjacent fields are full of invasive weeds. Please take further action in resolving the issues described above.

No signage identifying entry into either of two access points into Wascana Gardens where Building began approximately 16 or 17 years ago. Within the past two to three weeks a sign that would be suitable for an amusement park (my and other residents perception) was erected at the entry to Wascana Gardens Drive (houses back onto Reserve). Please note there are two entries into Wascana Gardens; hence two signs required.2. Tree and shrub bed located on Wascana Lane - city maintenance once a year and with the exception of one year and therefore has been left until August of each year when summer almost over. Partial maintenance performed at or around August 8,2022. There are shrubs and trees that have been dead for a number of years and have not been removed and/or replaced. Moms and Dads with children have been removing debris such as vapes, poop, drug paraphernalia etc regularly. Please contact Penny at 306--586-1817 who lives in neighborhood that wishes to speak with you about this and other concerns;3. When trees, shrubs and perennials die at entries to Wascana Gardens, Wascana Gate etc City workers eventually remove but do not replace.4. When individuals purchased lots in Wascana Gardens we were all given a professionally done brochure with respectable signage and access to the reserve from within the immediate area; neither happened. If the Developer is responsible for signage etc who polices the Developer when they don't follow through? 5. I perceive the City of Regina gets a failure rating for repairing potholes in this and other areas. Wascana View Road by Trans Canada Pipeline is a classic example of the City chatting up construction but coming up short for consistently repairing the damage to paved roads from the large trucks carrying heavy loads to construction sites.6. Rodents - rabbits, mice and voles are a real problem in this area. There are people in this area that refuse to mow there lawns until they get a notice from the City -a process that takes approximately six weeks to complete and by that time the weeds and rodents have multiplied. It is not uncommon for me to catch up to 30 mice and voles per month; this is perceived by me to be a public health issue. Rabbit population belongs in country but our City has made a choice to allow them free reign for portion of the population that protect them at the expense of damage to trees and shrubs and potential human health risk due to their feces. Australia has met with considerable success in reducing rabbit population over past few years with their sterilization program.7. Power Outages - there have been a steady increase in outages over the past six years and can occur up to two three times a week. I understand that the construction is great for our City. However the Municipal Government should plan for power requirements before Building permits issued coupled with knowing what their limits are. Thanks Lori for listening to my concerns. I am hopeful that this conversation will evolve into a favorable action plan. Respectfully, Lorraine Chypiska",8/24/2022 12:20,1,,,,,,

The location that I am referring to is the spray pad on Maple Ridge Drive. There is a large hole approximately 2.5 ft long x 1 ft wide x 1 ft deep located within inches of designated play area. This hole regularly fills with water as kids play in the area which not only creates the hazard of kids not realizing the hole is there, but a massive mud pit taking away from the enjoyment of the park. This hole has been there for at least 2 years and I have witnessed several kids falling into the hole and hurting themselves. Myself and other Maple Ridge residents have expressed our concerns to City or Regina employees working in the park and so far the only steps to address our concerns have been to fill the hole with more dirt (which has already eroded) and covering it with a barricade, which I believe creates additional hazard with kids running around it on a daily basis.

The city failed to remove the weeds from the beginning when they spread seed, which is the reason for the abundance of weeds through the area. It appears that the city needs to focus on weed control in this area. This is a new development which had the common areas sodded back in 2016. The problem is that feilds are open to the areawithout separation and this causing transfer of weeds to any finished area. The parks are getting increasing numbers of weeds and foxtails, due to no proper weed removal. Dandelions are constantly going to seed before the area is cut. I am concerned for the future of this area as it appears the city is neglecting this neighbour hood. We are tax payers and we request the common areas to be taken care of to an acceptable standard.

He is concerned about the overgrown trees and shrubs in the easement behind his street (MacPherson) and Cross Place. He knows that the easement has gas lines and Sask Power poles that need to be accessed by the utility companies and that the easements need to be kept accessible. He said when he calls the city about overgrown grass, the city sends workers out to cut the grass. He is thankful for that. His main concerns is that other households allow trees and shrubs from their properties to grow into the easement. He would like better enforcement from the city and if the property owners do not cut their trees/shrubs, that the city should remove them at the property owners? cost.

You can see from Google people have made paths to walk over the tracks.

According to the City they had changed their rules in May 2022 to not allow any base greater than 6 inches high. They are telling Remco that I can not have an 8 inch monument base. Given that I purchased the monument with an 8 inch base before May 2022 I should be allowed to have it installed. Since this Block 115W is almost full and others have been allowed to have their own non conforming monument bases constructed within it we also want the same fair treatment. Please allow us to put our prepaid constructed monument with 8 inch base on our double plot. Thank you for looking into this at your earliest convenience so that my family can be treated equally and have the 8 inch monument base constructed in Block 115W as others do.",9/16/2022 8:11,3,0.002029574243351817,0.9883167147636414,0.002430167980492115,0.004878247622400522,0.0008728965767659247,0.0014723375206813216

She and her husband used to live there but now rent it out. Her email is: micheal.fegan@yahoo.ie (note: her husband is from Ireland and the spelling of Micheal is correct) She had three issues/questions that she?d like action or a response to:1.Heaved pavement. She said that before COVID, she had spoken to city staff who told her that their property was on the list for repairs to the pavement in front of their house. She said the pavement on the street has heaved significantly, causing water to pool and creating a hazard. The neighbours to the east of their property recently had the pavement in front of their house fixed, but Shauna said they haven?t heard anything about their pavement. Can someone follow up on whether the pavement in front of their property is on a list for repairs, and provide an estimate, if possible? 2.City tree roots causing regular sewer backups. Shauna said that every two years the house has a sewer backup and the culprit is always city tree roots (they have no trees on the property). They are reimbursed for calling a sewer company to unblock the line, but she was wondering what the city does to prevent the sewer lines getting clogged up. It creates inconvenience and stress to deal with sewer back ups. I mentioned to her that I believe the city does preventative cleaning of sewer lines once every one or two years. Because I am not certain about this, can someone clarify if this is the case and explain the policy to Shauna?3.Care for boulevard and trees. Shauna also wanted to know what the city policy was for maintaining the boulevards and city trees. I explained that the city does encourage residents to mow the grass on boulevards and that thecity does prune and examine city trees if a resident reports a problem. Can someone provide information to Shauna about boulevards and city trees? Thanks so much! Cheryl",9/27/2022 8:36,1,,,,,,

We love the area and are always happy to see the construction crews around. Especially the excavators who provide endless entertainment to our two little girls. I am writing this morning to express my sadness and confusion regarding the sidewalk and street update to Reeve's Road and Bay. I am happy to see this work being done. It was a bumpy street that did needed a lift. However, I am disappointed that at the connection point between the two walking paths that Reeves Road separates there were no accessible ramps made to connect the two paths easily. Instead, there is a large 90 degree curb created. This leads all families who use the path (which has a playground in it) to have to go down the road to a sloped curb, and then cut back to the path when using a stroller, bike, sled, or anything of the like (wheelchair, electric scooter). In addition within the first park that starts on Neff Road, there is a VERY steep wood bridge that is very treacherous for people of all ages, especially during winter months as it's more than a 45 degree angle downwards, and is very slippery. It does not have to be so steep as while it is a water channel, there has no need for it during the 7 years we have lived in the area. It's excessively high. For a family friendly area our walkable greenspaces have become less child friendly and it makes me sad in those spots when we take walks to use the park or to walk to the SSLC and it's a bit more a headache than purely enjoying the beautiful paths our city has provided.

The change in maintenance to the areas surrounding the gravel paths along the water drainage spaces.

I believe you were in support of this being considered a nature reserve with reduced maintenance.

I guess it will take a person to trip over the fluctuations in the uneven paved surface or twist their ankle inthe huge depression obstacles and then sue the city. Secondly why is the city closing the hot asphalt plant on Oct 21st? Why not keep the plant operational and continue to repair major issues such as the Rochdale trail since these repairs were to be donein the spring of 2022.
