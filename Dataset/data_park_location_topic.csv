Ave. for the past 20 years. We use the path in our area daily and really love it. It just disappoints us that the city of Regina decides to run this Great city of ours like it is a small town. Why is it that they can?t use proper equipment to maintain the path. Like clean the path underneath the bridges so that you don?t have a single path to walk on a possible twist an ankle. Do a better job on snow removal, and even through some sand down on the icye spots. This morning I should have put my skates on instead of winter boots. There have been times when we have seen the city on the path cleaning snow when it did not need it, and times like now when it does need it and they have not been out all week. A better job would be much appreciated . This path is used by quite a few people fail and we would like to see our tax dollars used better. Also the parking lot at Rick Hanson play are could use some attention snow wise. A lot of people drive to the path and it also very icy with ruts and lack of snow removal. One other item not relating to snow removal is it sure would be nice to have the garbage's emptied on a regular bases. or maybe checked. There are some of then close to over flowing with bags of dog poo and other garbage, Thank you very much.

Owners are never far, but can't run as fast as their animals, so there is a few minutes of panic for children. Can you pls paint a symbol for dogs on leash on the paved openingsof this park in the spring, and send patrollers on occasion to ensure its enforcement?

The two parks I witnessed were Lakeridge and Teresa Stephenson's but I'm sure there are others.Why?Secondly if your looking to save 3 to 5 million dollars annually have an independent review conducted on the excessive application of Roadways Winter Maintenance Program(WMP). Just one recent example was the massive hauling of snow off the entirety of McCarthy Blvd. Firstly this was totally in violation of the guidelines set out in the WMP and secondly they did it days before double digit temperatures are forecast, that would have melted the majority of the snow. For years Roadways have relied on the trust and na?vet? of council to engage in the excessive application of the WMP.

I'm intrigued by the Adopt a Greenspace program and may look into it, but I also just wanted to put myself out there as a person who is growing a lot pollinator friendly plants at home, including around the edge of our property (what is colloquially sometimes called a ""hellstrip."") I'd be happy to talk more about this at any point, as well as discuss similar initiatives happening around the city via friends and acquaintances from Nature Regina and the new Butterflyway Ranger program (a David Suzuki initiative.) Anyway, hoping to see more widespread education on the viability of native prairie plants for rejuvenating landscapes and improving the natural health of our neighbourhoods!",4/1/21 10:11,1.0,50.461643,-104.667267,ST FRANCIS PARK,0.3432191544081412,6015 MIKKELSON DR,50.46472,-104.66765,Customer service,6004   5TH AVE,WEST,129

Lori Bresciani Councillor Ward 4 306-570-1995From: Jolene Horejda Sent: Wednesday, April 7, 2021 1:47:42 PM To: Lori Bresciani Subject: [External email] Question about Green Meadow Park Good afternoon Lori, I am a resident of the Greens on Gardiner and my home backs Green Meadow Park. It is a beautiful park, and is consistently full of people enjoying it. My question is with respect to the walking path in the park. About 75% of the park's paths have been paved (and have been from the time the park was developed), and the other 25% is what I would describe as gravel. The problem is that the parts of the path that are gravel are nearly always wet and quite muddy, with the exception of a few weeks in the driest part of the summer. I am not sure what the thinking was when the park was first developed as to why they didn't pave the entire park, but I am wondering if the city would give any consideration to paving the remainder of the path? The Greens is full of many walking paths, all of which are paved, but I am not sure why this stretch was never paved? My husband and I walk in this park almost every night and due to the giant mud pits at several points on the gavel portions, people just have to walk around all the mud and go on the grass instead. This really defeats the purpose of having the walking path at all. I would imagine this is especially irritating for bikes and baby carriages, etc. I am not one to normally send emails of this nature, but this question is something that bothers me on an almost daily basis!

The 7-11 is very popular with youth that attend school or play nearby and everyday they dump their garbage with 7-11 logos on the street.  I am picking up plastic straws, lids and cups on a daily basis.   There are no public garbage bins in the area.   It's really not the kids fault as they have nowhere to put their refuse.There needs to be 3 city maintained garbage cans in front of Jack Mackenzie school and in front of St. Gabriel schools.I spoke to the caretaker at St. Gabriel and he has the same problem every day picking up trash for the local convenience store.I have indicated in red where my proposed garbage bins would go.   It would also very much help those that walk their dog for dog owners to have a place to put their refuse. I have spoken to several neighbors that also have noticed a large rise in litter in the neighborhood and we would all be most appreciative.Thanks and hope the city will consider it as it would help keep our neighborhood clean.    best regards,Cam Teichroeb",4/21/21 8:29,1.0,50.4297859,-104.5231041,PRINCE WILLIAM PARK,0.4474633871262518,3860 BUCKINGHAM DR,50.4293245,-104.5293795,Littering,4220 E BUCKINGHAM DR,EAST,4

There are several garden beds that have gone to complete neglect with nothing but mulch. It looks terrible, if new trees and plants were planted I would happily adopt these garden beds and help with the care of these areas to keep 'the greens, green'. I can not understand how this is continuing to be neglected year after year. Especially since city maintenance workers do come to the park frequently... Do they not notice the neglect?...

Bordering our property is an easement with a sidewalk that runs from L'Arche Crescent to Argyle School's playground. The piles of twigs and dry leaves are unsightly and pose a potential fire hazard. Also, a few sections of tree trunks were left after the City's tree pruning in the back lane last fall.&nbsp;For more than three decades, we have mowed the grass and collected the leaves, but now (at age 67), the task of Spring clean-up of this City property is too much for us.

Hi Jason. I want to bring the state of Bundon Park to your attention. The park has really gone downhill the last couple of years. The grass area is mostly dead and starting to show more and more dirt. I know there are sprinklers but they haven't been turned on in a couple years. The wood chips in the flower beds need a refresh. The rock area around the play structure is showing a lot of landscape fabric and gets overrun with weeds. And unfortunately, the bushes and trees are being destroyed by both kids and rabbits the area. Sorry to go on and on, but its too bad a newer park is becoming so run down.

6/3/21 3:19,Parks Inquiry,TurfMntnc,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,I?m concerned about the use of Arlington Park for team sports over the course of the summer. It seems now to be numerous teams taking over the entire park from 5pm until 8:30/9:00 daily. This doesn?t allow for anyone else to enjoy thepark. They are also destroying the grass itself. This is supposed to be a green space and not a playground or sport training facility.

I understand these easements are the city's responsibility and it appears that some tree cutting took place this spring as there is a cut up tree in the easement behind my house. I'm not sure how often these easements are dealt with as I am new to Regina. It doesn't seem like this one has had much trimming recently. I thought that I would assist by cutting back all of the trees and bushes behind my property for ease of removal by the city. Hopefully this will make it easier to schedule someone to come and clear away the cut branches. As I noted, it appears some trees were cut down in the past and those limbs need to be removed as well.

I am a resident in Lakeridge and Im contacting you to alert you to the condition of Theresa Stevenson Park, 1399 Lakeridge Road North. This park has been taken over by dandelions. It?s never been so bad, it?s the maintopic of anyone walking the path, including kids and parents that come to use this park. &nbsp;I purchased my lot, which is directly next to this park in 2003 when the lots were in development stage. The park has always been maintained and dandelions controlled for the most part. There are many disgruntled residents now because of this new normal it seems. I live right next to this park, I take pride in my home and yard and I?ve been personally cutting the park grass about 12? out from my fence in order to try keep the dandelions from taking over my yard. It?s crazy now, taxes are sky high, it?s not right.I understand that dandelion spraying has been discontinued, I?m not sure but if so, this decision needs to be reversed. I?m hoping that you will look into this problem and realize the concern of myself and many others and take the initiative to correct this problem. I?d send pictures for reference but I?m not seeing an option to attach.&nbsp;In years past we would take concerns to Jerry F with proper results so I?m reaching out to you as Ward 10 Councillor on this matter.&nbsp;Thank you for your attention Sir.",6/14/21 13:57,1.0,50.5038161,-104.6603048,THERESA STEVENSON PARK,1.5801749476133684e-12,1399 N LAKERIDGE RD,50.50381609999999,-104.6603048,Dandelions,1399 N LAKERIDGE RD,WEST,96

We chose this location because we wanted to backa park and accepted that we would be paying higher taxes because we back a park. That being said, the park is constantly neglected by the city whether it be letting the grass get way to long or by never watering it and allowing it to dry out to the point ofbald dirt spots( this was last year that it was this dry). This year the weeds are absolutely ridiculous. We take pride in making our yard look nice but with the amount of weeds in the park it is impossible to keep them out of our yard. I would like to knowwhy we pay higher taxes for backing a park when the park is left to look rundown. Where does this tax money go? I also know that the city will issue notices and fines to home owners who are not taking care of their yard. My question is who is holding the cityaccountable for the same standard? Maybe the home owners who back these neglected city parks should be getting some of their unused tax dollars back as a fine to the city for the neglect of these parks. We all know this would not happen but it would sure benice if the city was held accountable and probably the easiest solution would be to use those tax dollars and properly take care of our parks by watering, cutting and weed control on a regular basis and take a little pride in the cities appearance.",6/14/21 14:14,1.0,50.4806799,-104.7079295,BAKER PARK,0.0,8801 SHERWOOD DR,50.4806799,-104.7079295,Budget issue,8801   SHERWOOD DR,WEST,128

She asked about the green space behind her house, which is park and bike/walking trail.Four years ago, Sask Power changed overhead lines and their work created a berm behind residents? yards. Ms. Mitchell said the berm has caused flooding in her and her neighbours? yards. Ms. Mitchell called the city three years ago, the city said it was Sask Power?s responsibility and she called Sask Power, and they said it was a city responsibility.Currently L?Arche is under construction with new sidewalks and pavement. During the construction, city staff made arrangements for a family with a disabled boy to access their back yard via the same green space referred to above. The city staff said they would fix the green space once construction is done and residents have front yard access again.Would it be possible to investigate the berm that Ms. Mitchell is upset about and fix that at the same time as the rest of the green space? Ms. Mitchell can be contacted at 306-586-0743.I would appreciate being informed on what steps are taken. Thank you!

When the road was first paved there were plastic yellow markers denoting the edge of the roadway but they didn't survive the first winter. As a result an unmarked hazard has been present for nearly 10 years.The lack of a permanent delineation between the road and ditch is directly responsible for my mother falling off the road and breaking her arm 2 years ago while running. In absence of a curb there should be wood posts along the edge of the road so the edge of the road can be determined in all weather conditions. Even while cycling past the choke point there drivers get impatient because they assume the road is wider than it appears as the dirt looks like pavement from a distance.It would also cut down on the number of snowmobiles riding along that open stretch during the winter.,6/22/21 13:41,1.0,50.47672,-104.6875699,PINES OF NORMANVIEW PARK,0.2790443742268325,1098 DOROTHY ST,50.47773,-104.68396,safety,7338   1ST AVE,WEST,2

Hi Cheryl. We live in your grouping in Hillsdale. The city never mows the easement behind our house. It?s up to my waist. We are constantly phoning every year. The mosquitoes in our yard are insane. On the opposite side of our bay thereis a walkway in their easement. The city is constantly maintaining it. Even whipper snipping near people?s fences. It?s beautiful. People even plant flowers because it is so well maintained. They pay no extra taxes compared to us. No kids live on their sideof the bay. My kids used to use ours for going to school. It was like walking through a jungle. There is garbage. They?ve tripped and hurt themselves. They either have to take an extra long path or trespass through our neighbours? yards to now avoid it onthe way to school. Is there some way that we can change this? I would have no troubles getting my neighbours to sign some sort of petition. Hillsdale is such a beautiful neighbourhood and taking care of this easement would make it even more so. It?s also veryunfair of the city to be handing out fines to people not mowing their grasses while keeping its own property in this type of shape. Up to an adults? waist is totally unacceptable.

This means a lot of extra work for homeowners who aretrying to zeroscape and keep weeds out of their backyards. I appreciate that the corner is too wet for the riding mowers; however, we are kindly asking that the city either uses a push lawnmower or a whipper snipper as soon as possible to get rid of the foxtailbefore it goes fully to seed and blows into everyone's backyard. I find it ironic that I was ""sited"" by the city for having foxtail in my backyard before I finished my landscaping a few years ago and received a letter from the city. This corner of the parkis a lot worse than my backyard ever was before my landscaping was finished.

Every year trees have died and never replaced. Almost every tree that green view is backing is dead and cut down. Tons are dead in the park. I would guess prob 20-30 total trees in this park have been cut down and never replaced. The grass is burnt never gets watered I never see anyone out maintaining this park. When I was home in the winter I witnessed a city of regina plow truck drive as fast as he could to plow the path pretty much right behind my house and all that grass along the path is gone. For paying 6400.00 in taxes is insane for not getting anything done in the park. It?s a huge eyesore and everyone I know has been calling the city and nothing is getting done. Anything you can do to help would be appreciated. Thanks again Lori.

We have a large wood sign at the end of our street, but it is showing significant aging. Our neighbourhood loves this sign, and in talking to neighbours it is a project we have wished to be completed for several years now.With all the construction on Whelan, I feel this would be an ideal time for city crews to put a fresh coat on it. I would even gladly do it myself if the city is unable to complete this.My worry is if this goes unattended, it will decay past repair.Please let me know if this is something that can be completed this summer to help beautify our ward.

Please email SRadmin@regina.ca with your response including the SR number in the subject line within 1 business day. Good morning, We are currently updating the outside of our home on 9 Estey Pl to improve its street appeal. As long as you look from a distance, it looks fantastic; however on closer looks to get to to the front of our house you must first risk your vehicles undercarriageon Spence St (which currently also sports a sink hole) and then turn onto Estey place but please be sure to avoid all the potholes and broken pavement. I was shocked when last year the BACK ALLEY behind the Atlas hotel was redone before the embarrassment ofSpence St and the bays along it were left in complete disarray. We have lived here since 2006 and our taxes have gone up every year. We are now paying over $4000 for a road that is ruining our vehicles.We have a grass space on our bay and yesterday was only the 3rd time I have actually witnessed the sprinklers on to water the grass. There is a dying tree and large bush that needs to be trimmed but I guess that is not the City grass cutters department?I know others have complained about Spence St and our bay. Every time my tax notice comes I want to send a picture of our terrible roads and I wonder why my taxes are not being applied to my street in my neighbourhood?

It was exciting to have it improve. We do appreciate having this done even through the 4-6 weeks turned into just over 12. The problem we have is the center of the bay. They removed the curb and took out the sidewalk, according to workers there could be no sidewalk because of the tree, which is a problem. The PROBLEM is that the tree has grown so much that it now blocks out light for half the bay causing it to be dark and uncomfortable to half the bay. So they did come and only partway filled it and now it is growing weeds and looks awful. So what we suggest is that the tree needs to be removed, level the ground and fill it with rocks. The reason for this is that the city now only comes once a year to cut and water it and has left the rest of the care to the residents. Unfortunately no one on the bay except one person is able to do the work and he is not around very often. So please inform the department that is responsible for it to make our bay look good and is environmentally friendly. There would be no further cost to the city and we would have a good looking bay. Thank you so much for your time reading this and hopefully something can be done with our bay.",7/26/21 13:55,1.0,50.4567687,-104.5401026,PARKRIDGE PARK,0.4946224223193899,1243 ROSSIE DR,50.45826,-104.53352,"lack of maintenance, poor appearance",7   WATTS BAY,EAST,5

I'm very thankful for everything that is done and look forward to seeing how we progress in the future. I have a couple small issues that I have tried on my own to have resolved however nothinghas been done. First of all there is a ""construction next to highway"" sign on the exit ramp off Lewvan going west. It was put up when the Lewvan overpass was being built and stayed there while the bypass was being built. I contacted the city and departmentof highways regarding it and no one wants to claim it. There is no construction and it can be confusing for new drivers.Next is there are a lot of blue rubber bands being tossed aside by our mail carriers. Not only is it littering but it is also a hazardto our wildlife (ducks, squirrels, birds). Again I contacted the post office regarding this a couple years ago and never received a reply. These rubber bands are all over, as well there are many by pickup boxes for the carriers. I did have a picture of onebox that had at lest 25 by it, however when I did not get a reply I gave up!The last issue, you may not be able to help. It is in the Harbour Landing area. When I walk my dog on the crushed gravel side of the creek I noticed that there is no garbage can fromwhen I go onto the path on Gordon Road till I get off the path on Harbour Landing Drive. I also like to pick up plastic bags and put them into a close garbage, however, I don't like carrying other peoples garbage that far. It is almost until I get back tothe Walmart area that there is a can!Thank you for your time and consideration into my little problems. I hope you are healthy and you have a great summer.

They were discharging the grass onto the road. Grass clippings in summer is worse then ice in the winter for motorcycles. It takes all traction away and causes serious accidents.Today at 853am I saw a bunch of grass clippings a city of Regina mower left in the intersection of University Park Dr and Arcola Ave. This would be even worse as it?s a corner and a motorcycle would have no chance.I called the City right away and demanded it get addressed and cleaned up and that the maintenance department instruct mower operators not to discharge grass clippings on streets.At 3pm the grass was still in this intersection. I will be advising the motorcycle association in Regina to watch for this and if an accident is caused because of grass clippings H-D the City will be at fault not the operator of his or her motorcycle. We pay enough to enjoy our machines and don?t need poor city maintenance to cause more harm!Darryl Haas",8/3/21 9:01,1.0,50.4446073,-104.5080944,PACER PARK,1.0756947385253302,2501 ANAQUOD RD,50.43604999999999,-104.5010099,Visitor complaint: Poor city maintenance causing,2110   ANAQUOD RD,EAST,6

I often see advertisements run by the city of Regina asking folks to keep their yards/lawns neat and properly maintained. Is there any chance the city could clean up its own mess on this boulevard?

The City has spent a Lot of money developing this Westerra park. There was a lot of activity. However, there is no parking, absolutelynone. There is no bathroom, portable or otherwise. We ( the city) have spent a lot on this cricket pitch. Please complete those obvious requirements. Next. Please reinstall the three way stop at Dewdney and Dorothy street. Traffic now is heavy and enters Dewdney/Dieppe place, from the west at 70 km/ hr. ( this means 80 for most people). It has become difficult to exit Dieppe via Dorothy, In a safe manner. We had temporary,all way stop signs recently, and it helped a lot. Please install a permanent all way stop atDewdney Ave and Dorothy street. Next. Since covid, the bike path has become very very busy, particularly in AE Wilson park . We could use signage and Garbage / bag dispensers for Dog Feces. It is an Issue. Particularly in winter. Please install appropriatesignage and disposal sites. Every Major City In Canada has them . Dogs are very popular. Next. The ball Diamond at Dieppe school is absolutely beautiful and has nightly adult softball games . This is wonderful. However. Adults need to pee. This means the hiddencorners of the closed Dieppe school are being used as a bathroom. Perhaps a portable bathroom is required. Thx ..I hope you take all of these suggestions into serious consideration.

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Shanon, In advance of your attendance in Westerra on August 5th I have the following questions:(1) Why has the City of Regina allowed the assets turned over to the City from Harvard Forester to go to waste?(2) How can the City of Regina justify spending property tax dollars to replace assets turned over to the City from developers in pristine condition that are now dead and weed infested?(3) How does the City of Regina expect community members, home builders and businesses to invest in Westerra when the City of Regina can't be bothered to take care of public spaces in Westerra until there has been sufficient public outcry?(4) How can the City of Regina expect property owners to comply with the Community Standards Bylaw regarding weeds and overgrown vegetation when the City of Regina is incapable of maintaining City property in compliance with that Bylaw?(5) Why is the City of Regina seemingly surprised and ill-equipment to deal with weeds in communities on the edge of the City like Westerra?(6) Why is the City of Regina content to spend tax dollars to dole out a pound of cure instead of using a fraction of those funds to invest in an ounce of prevention?(7) Why does the City of Regina rely on complaints from community members instead of taking a proactive approach to weed management?I do appreciate you taking the time to attend on Thursday. My frustration is not directed at you personally but in your capacity as a representative of the City of Regina, which has largely ignored Westerra (to the detriment of the its residents) since theCity of Regina took over maintenance of the public spaces from Harvard Forester.

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Although I do not live in Ward 8, I frequently travel on Dewdney Ave, west of Lewvan Dr, and on McCarthy Blvd, between Dewdney Ave and Mikkelson Dr, and would like to express my concerns regarding the vegetation on the boulevards alongthese streets. I understand that this vegetation is meant to be ""low maintenance natural wild flowers"" but I feel it looks very bad and projects an image of unkempt and neglected City property. I feel it gives a particularly shabby image of our City, especiallyso close to the RCMP Heritage Centre, which is a major tourist attraction, with visitors from all parts of our country and the world.",8/6/21 14:05,1.0,50.4085375,-104.63609,QUEEN STREET PARK,0.1651546776730356,4410 QUEEN ST,50.40929999999999,-104.63809,Lack of maintenance,231   SUNSET DR,SOUTH,5

8/6/21 20:19,Irrigation,IrrigMtnc,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,Reeves Park in Gardiner Heights I believe has an underground sprinkler line leak as there is some water bubbling up to the surface making a small consistent puddle no matter if the sprinklers are on or not (must be a feeder water line to the underground sprinklers). It is not a major leak but it is leaking enough to make a small puddle that has been there for at least 3 days now so I thought I would at least report it to the city. The leak is right beside the walking path through Reeves Park just as you cross Reeves Road heading east on the path right across from the first light standard as you enter the Park from Reeves Road.

Not sure if they had been there previouly? I'm curious if we could start one on the boulevard in front of my friends house on Victoria Ave.? She lives on the 3200 block of Victoria Ave. I'm thinking of next year. I'm thinking we could do the whole block long boulevard? Is this something we could do? Would the city help with seeds etc.? It would save the guy who comes along and cuts what little grass grows there. Would we need all the nieghbours on board?

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Hello, Cheryl. I am a property owner near Kinsmen Park South and use the park on a daily basis to walk with my family. I am concerned about public vehicles using the gravel path/road, since this is a risk to the safety of people out walking/biking/playing. For instance, on a weekly basis, there are at least 15 cars parked along the NW-SE path. This is a group of rugby players that, when finished their practice, all speed down the road to get back to Queen Street (not sure that they even have a permit). I even witnessed a person drive through the grass the other day, after having gained access through the open gate at Queen St. This morning, I noticed tire tracks and garbage all over in the ?parking area? by the bathrooms near the water park/spray pad. This is also probably due to someone using the open gates to enter the park with their vehicle, albeit at night.I notice that all of the gates (Queen St; Lakeview Ave; Kings Rd) are left open at all hours of the day. I would like for them to be closed so that public vehicles can no longer access this gravel path and it be left to city service vehicles only. I would also like for there to be signage to relay the message that it is a not for public vehicle use/has restricted access. If this is not the case, I would like for a review of the parks &amp; open space bylaw or an update to the policies regarding Kinsmen Park in particular. It is only a matter of time until someone gets injured. There are children and dogs running around who are most at risk. I would appreciate a prompt response to my concern.

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Hi Andrea, Thanks for your email! I?m copying Service Regina who can forward your request to the appropriate department for action. I?m not sure if the same department responsible for easements manages gates. I was not aware of that incident. I can?t imagine why someone would crash the gate. Service Regina, I would like to be copied on the response to Andrea. Thank you and have a great day. CherylHi Cheryl, hope all is well! I'm writing in regards to the easement at the end of 25th Avenue on Bell Street (at the T intersection). I am wondering if you know or can find out if there are plans to fix and/or replace the gate at the entrance of the easement? On June 16th, there was a woman who smashed through the gate with her car and drove the length of it before crashing at the other end. My husband was the one who called the police about this and was at the scene so I can testify that this actually happened. Following this, there has been a significant amount of construction in the easement. As such, the gate was never repaired. Due to all the construction in the easement most of the grass has been worn down and it looks like a through road now. It is frequently used as a through road by residents. It has become quite unsafe to walk or ride your bike in. There is usually just a chain or a piece of do not cross plastic tape going across the entrance to the easement. We live very close to this easement and enjoy using it.

The departments are asked to respond directly to SRAdmin@regina.ca with the information required within two business days so that one coordinated response can be sent to the resident from Service Regina. Service Regina will ensure the Mayor is copied on the coordinated response. SR 2111778 to Gravel AlleySR 2111858 to ForestrySR 2111859 to Parks Dear Mayor Sanders, My husband took me to the hospital at 8:30 this morning, city trucks were parked on 400 block Argyle St.N. From 7:30 - After 11:00 supposedly waiting for a grader. The workers are sitting with trucks running. What a waste of fuel and man hours just sitting doing nothing. The grader operator should call for the trucks when he needs them. My husband and I walk this area everyday and see this happening all the time. The catwalks in this area are disgusting. We saw 2 city workers trimming trees in the catwalk across from Thom Collegiate and leave twigs and lots of glass on the sidewalk. They left the mess and didn?t pick up the glass. Also the park on Lawson st. trimmed the shrubs down to nothing but can?t bother to pick up the debris they created. The sand where children play have acorns and sticks in it. Very unsafe for children. We also witnessed 3 city work trucks parked to do a curb box. It?s no wonder why our taxes have to go up with the wasted time and fuel costs of these big trucks running for nothing. There needs to be some kind of system in place to check that the work is being done in a timely and acceptable manner. The last time I put a complaint with the city. There were repercussions for our home. The grader in winter would leave a big pile of snow at end of our driveway instead of putting the blade down to take it away. We have a 4 wheel drive so could get over the pile. Also scraped our boulevard and peeled part of the earth up and ruined the grass I planted. So this time I?m going straight to you the mayor and praying you can figure out what needs to be done to fix the problem.

My son is autistic and uses the trampoline during the winter months. We would like it back. Although the city claims there was no removal on that day, my neighbour saw city crews confiscate it last Tuesday November 23 at 6am by the snow plow crew that clears the pathways.

12/30/21 8:13,Parks Inquiry,PathMntnc,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,Hi...I had heard that new snow removal budget included pathways in Merlin Park. This winter this path was cleared a couple of times so I assume it is an enhanced service. This last snowfall the city came and cleared the sidewalk aroundthe Park across from my house but they did not do any of the pathway to the west to Pasqua street or east towards Albert street along Merlin Park. It seems odd to just come and do the sidewalk at this park by my house. Was the other just missed? Can you advisewhat is the enhanced pathway snow clearing for this area if there is in a response by email or call. much appreciate the parks staff care of the Merlin park this year.

The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.What is the point of having a skating rink in Matt Park in Lakeridge addition without decent maintenance? It was scraped off Saturday, Jan 22/22 but the job they did was very pathetic. I have pictures of the job they did. The residentsof the area could not even consider using the ice with the snow piles that were left on the ice. Not sure what the flooding cycle is supposed to be but I would say it hasn't been flooded in weeks. I went out and shoveled it off so our kids can get out andenjoy it. I don't mind pitching in and making sure it's decent but every time the city does their job it's becoming clear they don't care and pretty soon there will be no point of having this option in the area. We have seen the city come and plow it a fewtimes a week but they leave without flooding it. Last week when they plowed it they pushed all the snow across the field and left it in front of our little hill. Now the kids can not use the hill to toboggan. This is the second year for the rink and both yearsthe maintenance has been a disappointment. Its frustrating to see how poorly the city has looked after it. That goes for the park in general.",1/24/22 13:32,1.0,50.5073371,-104.6536052,MAAT PARK,0.0,1701 N ELKS RD,50.5073371,-104.6536052,Poor rink maintenance,1701 N ELKS RD,WEST,29

The street side of the park on Parkland Drive was finally being cleared for a couple weeks and now it is being ignored again. theside of the park on Arens Road is constantly cleared but not Parkland Drive. By the time they do clear the snow is packed so it is cleared very well but atleast there is some snow removed. also i do the same requests for the path going through Parkland Park from Arens Road to Parkland Drive and the bays next to the park. This is a high traffic area for pedestrians - going to school, catching the bus, exercise. i don't understand why it does receiveregular snow removal attention. i I have also asked that the snow be cleared going by the benches and play structure. it was done a couple times last year. again it is a high pedestrian traffic area. i shouldn't have to make a request everytime snow should be cleared or have someone to explainto me why snow removal is hit or miss. I am a little frustrated about this, again snow gets packed by all the traffic and doesn't get cleared properly when and if it is done. if it was a seldom used Park paths then i could understand but there is a great dealof pedestrian traffic that has to plow through snow all the time.

The city of Regina can purchase andinstall over 20 new Ukrainian flags to show solidarity, but cannot manage to maintain the flags of its own nation, let alone the flags of fallen servicemen and fallen sisters. If the city of Regina is unable or unwilling to change the flag by Easter weekend,I will have to resort to damaging the key on the flag pole to replace the flag with my own flag at my own cost. I have taken full HD 4k video of the Canadian flag tattered in the wind with the camera panning to the war memorial. It's going to look awful if that flag isn't replaced and I resort to my tactics to get media attention. City of Regina police also let Malcolm ruiter rape an underage girl at Sask Polytech school grounds. Go ask the counsellor at the school for my records to vindicate my claims. Protect the native children? You're letting a prominent white family's son get awaywith raping an underage native girl. Just so you are aware.

5/5/22 12:57,Parks Inquiry,No Subtype,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"Regarding File #: 2021-M-69285, 2802 Partridge CrescentWe have fixed this fence several times over the last 20 years. The problem is re-occurring. I believe it is due to an elevation problem with the easement that is adjacent to the property. There is a significant elevation difference between 2802 property and the city owned easement. I would consider this to be a potential design error at time of subdivision development. I suspect something the City would have approved. Further, the developer did not build a proper retaining wall which is a major contributing factor to the fence problem. Another contributing factor is the easement elevation in comparison to the street and pipeline ROW. It is much too low. Every time there is measurable rainfall and from spring melt, the easement floods (up to 4"" or 5"" deep) for most of its length. This regular saturation of the earth in this area is a major contributor to the movement of the soil on 2802 Partridge, along the easement, and the earth that the fence stands on.What it comes down to is, I am kindly requesting that a person from the appropriate department call me to discuss the situation. We are tired of putting time and money into correcting the fence problem only to watch the problem to return. We firmly believe that this problem was created by the significant elevation difference and the very regular flooding. Please don't have someone go the site, inspect/evaluate it, then call me and say its a property owner problem. I would like to meet someone on site for a discussion.",5/5/22 13:11,2.0,50.4931745,-104.6208125,ENGLEWOOD PARK,0.1568255955304933,165 PETERSMEYER ST,50.49221,-104.62243,Elevation difference between property and eas,2802   PARTRIDGE CRES,NORTH,-1

5/12/22 16:40,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"This service request has been created in response to an inquiry sent to Councillor Findura. The department is to respond to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.To Ward 5 Councilor John Findura, Regarding: Wilfrid Walker Park in Gardener Park neighborhood I wish to petition the City of Regina to evaluate the condition of Wilfrid Walker Park and implement immediate action to address the deterioration of the park. Wilfrid Walker Park is used by many people! Year around there are residents playing with their children, as well as teams and individuals using the field for exercise. Of course this park is adjacent to a soccer pitch and the Wilfrid Walker School playground, so there are hundreds of school children using the field all year round. The city maintains a much-loved outdoor board less ice rink during the winter months at the northwest corner of the park, which of course impacts the condition of the underlying grass. I recognize it is hard to mitigate on a yearly basis, but the extent of the damage goes beyond the rink area. As I see it, there are several issues to be addressed: 1) Out of control growth of thistle and other weeds. 2) Ruts in the ground, especially along the west perimeter of the park where service vehicles drove during the work done to install the Sasktel fibre optic cable (2020). 3) Watering the grass. Apparently there is a broken water irrigation line, as well as the fact that the sprinklers are manual that seems to be an ongoing problem in even initiating a watering schedule. The only watering happening at Wilfrid Walker Park is in the area closest to the New Gardiner Park development, where a different set of sprinklers was installed when that part of the park was developed. 4) Proper lawn care practices such as application of fertilizer, aeration, and over-seeding grass, etc to bring back the grass to the condition where the weeds cannot overtake the grass. Thank you for your consideration of this petition.

5/13/22 8:44,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"May 2022 1728 Clive Bay, Regina, SK. S4V 2R8 To the City of Regina Park Maintenance Regarding: Wilfrid Walker Park in Gardener Park neighbourhood I wish to petition the City of Regina to evaluate the condition of Wilfrid Walker Park and implement immediate action to address the deterioration of the park. Wilfrid Walker Park is used by many people! Year around there are residents playing with their children,as well as teams and individuals using the field for exercise. Of course this park is adjacent to a soccer pitch and the Wilfrid Walker School playground, so there are hundreds of school children using the field all year round. The city maintains a much-lovedoutdoor boardless ice rink during the winter months at the northwest corner of the park, which of course impacts the condition of the underlying grass. I recognize it is hard to mitigate on a yearly basis, but the extent of the damage goes beyond the rinkarea. As I see it, there are several issues to be addressed: 1) Out of control growth of thistle and other weeds. 2) Ruts in the ground, especially along the west perimeter of the park where service vehicles drove during the work done to install the Sasktel fibre optic cable (2020). 3) Watering the grass. Apparently there is a broken water irrigation line, as well as the fact that the sprinklers are manual that seems to be an ongoing problem in even initiating a watering schedule. The only watering happening at Wilfrid Walker Park is inthe area closest to the New Gardiner Park development, where a different set of sprinklers was installed when that part of the park was developed. 4) Proper lawn care practices such as application of fertilizer, aeration, and over-seeding grass, etc to bring back the grass to the condition where the weeds cannot overtake the grass. Thank you for your consideration of this petition.

They indicated that they know the park is very low there and there is underground sprinklers etc and are worried about damage to the park as that backs right behind their home. The other concern is many contractors leave a mess with ruts etc and after and are usually not held accountable to repair it! They do not want to go down that road.

I have lived in the Westerra subdivision since 2019. When I moved here the grass along the walking paths looked beautiful. The grass died in the common areas in the summer 2020. This happened shortly after Forster Harvard Development handed over responsibility of the maintenance to the city. The city has taken 2 years to fix this issue. In the spring of 2022 and without communication the city has started with repairing this area. The problem is that the city has done substandard work of not properly spreading the seed throughout the area. It is evident just looking at the area that seed was applied improperly. Most of the large area has zero to little seed spread. Some areas have heavy spread seed and there is no consistency whatsoever.

6/2/22 9:20,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"June 1st - I would like to bring to your attention a situation that happened this morning that I feel should be made known and rectified. I?m a long time resident of Uplands and take my dogs to the new dog park in the Mount Pleasant dog park every morning. I love the dog park, it?s great. This morning I went with my two dogs as usual and noticed that there were some City workers weed wacking both inside and outside of the fenced compound. We went in the front gates and I let my dogs free. We made the loop almost all the way around until we got to the east side of the park. There were several city workers weed wacking at the fence and a we got closer I realized they had the fence wide open. My dogs beelined it and escaped. The city worker closest to the gate saw them coming and just stood there and smiled. I was too far away to even try to catch up. My two large dogs were now loose. This is a danger for a number of reasons. My dogs could have attacked another dog or person and hurt them. They could have run out into traffic and been killed. It took me an hour to chase after them and finally get them leashed. As you can imagine, I was not impressed. If an incident had occurred, I would have held the city liable and taken legal action. This is not an acceptable way to conduct work in and around a compound directly built to contain potentially dangerous if loose animals. To prevent future incidents, I propose that either A: signage is put up at both entrances, alerting dog owners that the gates are open so that they DO NOT let their dogs off leash. Or B: inform workers that the gates of any off leash dog park under maintenance should remain CLOSED at all times to prevent dangerous incidents from occurring. I appreciate your time to read this letter and I hope you will take actions to prevent any further situations from occurring.",6/2/22 9:39,1.0,50.4880054,-104.6030728,ELMVIEW EAST PARK,0.2381856349031172,202 ELMVIEW RD,50.48987,-104.60473,Loose dogs,126   LLOYD CRES,NORTH,75

There were many cars using the walking path to drive on and then park for an event. This is due to the gate being left unlocked on the west side from the entrance at Queen St. I can't imagine that this is allowed and if it is, it definitely shouldn't be. My children shouldn't have to dodge out of the way of a car on a park path, and is a danger to everyone using these parks to have fun and leisure time.

There is also a triangular green space between the berm and the 3000 blk of Lacon and 3100 blk of Park S twhich is never cut either. The staff are here, the mower is here, but no mowing happens.

I appreciate the quick attention to my request but are very disappointed with the quality of work that was done. As we have noticed in past years, the lawn is cut by a riding mower. As a result, there is trim work that is needed to be done in between and around the trees. This was not done. There was no clean up of the leaves in the back corner and the sidewalk in front and the walkway were not swept or cleaned up in any way. There does not appear to be any work done to the trees to clean them up.As for the work that was done along the neighbors fence, we did not put in a request for that to be done but it was also done very poorly.We have had ongoing issues with this neighbor re: the walkway maintenance (it is well documented by many Supervisors and/or Managers throughwritten correspondence or those who have come by to discuss), so I am not requesting that work be cleaned up.But I am requesting that this green space (by 2902 Lacon St) be cleaned up well. There needs to be ""City"" pride in the work the City of Reginaemployees are doing, regardless of the size of the job or it's importance in the big scheme of city jobs.

He introduced himself as the team lead and it looked like he was doing some trainingfor what I assumed was the seasonal team. What is most impressive was that when I mentioned there were several trees by the childrens play structure that had significant dead branches. He first indicated he would check them out. I mentioned I would send a service request (based what a different cityemployee advised me to do a week earlier when he was doing work in the area. Tim said that was not necessary as he was going to check it out with his team and would pass the information along accordingly. He advised that some branches were very high and would require the ""Forestry team. He did not brush me off and took extra time toexplain what his team does in the park vs the other teams.

It is in behind homes on Laird Cres. It must be at least 12-18 inches tall in places. I keep the service alley beside my house cut or it would look like **** by now, like the back does. 2-3 times a summer is all we are asking for. Kids can't even play out there like I did when I was a kid. Have this same problem every year for about the last 10 years. They cut beside the handicap home on Sherwood drive and then they stop when they get to the first of trees, just south of where I live. They cut on the other side of the channel but not this side. Would be nice to have the bushes trimmed and cleaned up as there are broken branches all over. Over the years I have cleaned up some of the smaller ones.

My cousin (from Kelowna) and I were appalled at the deplorable condition of the grounds. I was told years ago that these sites would receive perpetual care. City bylaw advises that there is care and maintenance provided. Neither of which is evident. There is no water service so very difficult to water grass if there is any grass. Gopher holes are abundant and large. I was advised the City opted out of replacing any water lines back in the 80?s and 90?s and there are no funds to do any repairs. Other than up righting fallen headstones. As the Alderwoman for my Ward and Councillor for the Ward the cemetery is located in I would like to discuss this issue. It is disgraceful the City has allowed this cemetery to become what almost looks like a war zone. How disrespectful to those people buried there and their families.

The department is not required to respond however if a response is provided, ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Dear Lori, Hope you are doing well. My husband and I live in The Creeks and back the SaskPower building and side the SaskPower emergency access lane. I contacted you awhile back about it being a dog run and thank you for taking immediate action as it really did help,however, it has unfortunately become a problem again. We are wondering if there could be signage posted in that access lane, just like they have on Wascana View Drive where it says No Trespassing or something similar. To make matters worse, we had an incidentlast week where three men in a vehicle pulled up close against our fence, stopped their vehicle, and proceeded to use drugs. They urinated on our fence and our neighbours fence. We eventually contacted the police and they waited for them to exit the lane andthen pulled them over. It was really scary. Yesterday, the maintenance man mowed the back lanes that were filled with dandelions and the debris flew over our fence and filled our yard and patio where we were sitting enjoying a nice Sunday afternoon. He hadtaken off the mower bag to get it done faster and it was on when he mowed inside SaskPower's property. My husband is in his 70's and I'm in my 60's and we are so proud of our home and don't want to move. We pay over $6k in taxes and can't believe this is happeningin our neighbourhood. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and have a great day.

This morning a Parks Dept. summer staffer weed-whacked right through the bark of several of our small trees. This kills the tree. She completely cut through a little tree several neighbors planted to replace one of the many dead trees in the park. I don't really blame her. Obviously she received no training. This neighborhood donated money towards the trees. We want all the dead trees replaced and all the small trees caged with wire cages, which will protect against both rodents and Parks staff. This is just stupid. According to my records, the neighborhood asked for trees in the park for 50 (yes, fifty) years before we finally got some. Now, half are dead, mostly at the hands of the Parks Dept. Please see that cages are put around the remaining trees immediately. I wish I could make you understand how angry and upset we all are, but I guess that's what elections are for - we have been asking for wire cages for 3 years, pretty much since a year after the trees were planted and we realized Parks staff were attacking them.

After my request, they came out and cut the grass behind my house (in the east ditch on Courtney St, north of Mapleford Gate) but they made four passes with the riding lawnmower cutting (back and forth)but did not cut to the roadway. I honestly wish I had taken pictures of the first time to show the progression until they actually get out here and cut it all the way. I realize a lot of this work is done by summer students and that someone has a job of cutting this piece of grass, but not around the trees because that is someone else?s job and then someone else comes to whipper snip because that is their job.

6/16/22 13:44,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"Request Details Description The City or School Board mowed the school property soccer field from the school to the bike path today. They have not string trimmed around the trees adjacent to Meadow Park Cr. fence line and the bike path or mowed. The last time was more than two weeks ago. Today I noticed they have done behind the west side's and I was told the south side was done, but not well. In years past the City sent string trimmers, for around trees, Monday or Tuesday and later that day or the next day they sent the Zero Spin Lawn mowers to mow the lawn/down the weeds on a weekly basis. (It would be nice to know their present weekly schedule as rain the past couple weeks cannot be blamed for delays in weekly maintenance.). One of our residents again was out with her personal lawn mower to mow down her next door neighbor's dandelions/grass on city property. Should she keep doing City business, at her expense, pretty soon will they expect it? Unacceptable. MPECC really requires the City to maintain their property, on a weekly basis, barring unpredictable service disruptions that affects all Civic property owners City wide. The above is from a concerned resident who retired from the City not long ago. There are city parks that have no dandelions yet ours is full. We have young children playing soccer in this park as well as numerous football try outs, that can't be good for anyone who has allergies. There are areas where the large mowers can't reach that have not been cut or touched this year. I have lived in the crescent for 17 years and have never seen the park so bad and is unacceptable.

The dandelions are taking over and the grass is not even being cut in areas. I live on Meadow Park Crescent and I have actually gone out and purchased a lawn mower because it got so bad. I am presently cutting the grass (mostly weeds) behind the six houses on the east side of our crescent. I should not have to do that. I moved here so that I would not have to cut grass or shovel snow. The mowers come to the field behind the school and do a terrible cutting job and then leave. They are leaving strips uncut and they ignore the area by the walking path and our yards. This walking path is used continuously and it is a disgrace the way the city is dealing with this situation. There are places where the mower takes one swipe of park area and then leaves the rest. I am certainly not the only one cutting behind my home trying to control the spread of weeds and the haven for bugs. Long grass promotes a haven for ticks and other bugs. The dandelion situation is out of control. Respect our parks - take care of them. We are asking that you take care of our parks.

City workers havebeen here watering the weeds in the easment, but they seem to sit around in the trucks and occasionally water. I saw one person pulling weeds on Thursday of last week, however what they accomplished in a day was pathetic. I am a 67 year old with terminal cancerand would do a better job weeding than these young people you hire. There was a young girl who spent more time on her cell phone and sitting in the truck than anything. Please have the weeds pulled in the easments. As a side note, the area where they attempted to grow grass appears to only have weeds growing. I thought they were supposed to be growing grass. Can they send people to pull out the weeds? Still unsure why theydidn?t pull the weeds before spraying the ?drought hardy seed spray.?",6/27/22 19:13,3.0,50.45385,-104.69538,SEREDA PARK,0.0,7955 BARLEY CRES,50.45385,-104.69538,"Weeds in park, lack of maintenance",7955   BARLEY CRES,WEST,-1

The city was supposed to be planting grass. The grass died and weeds took over the entire area. The residents are outraged and have filed numerous tickets to bring this to the attention of the maintenance staff. The only action the city has performed is to cut and water the weeds. This is a new subdivision and it?s causing concerns for homeowners who back onto the easment. This area is supposed to be sodded, per the subdivision plan. It is nearly ALL weeds now. The city doesn?t seem to be maintaining this greenspace at all. Personally they shouldn?t have approved a plan for greenspace if they cannot maintain the area. Please escalate these concerns to have the weeds removed properly. We?ve been dealing with this issue since the summer of 2020 when Regina took over maintenance responsibilities. There are large fields full of weeds surrounding the subdivision and neighbouring on property lines of peoples brand new homes. After filing numerous tickets, the city still hasn?t plowed the fields on the entrance to Westerra or behind Lentil Avenue. The reason for the weeds in the easement is that they spread rapidly when they go to seed and the feilds aren?t regularly being cut.

It continues to get worse year after year and the City is not doing anything to try and combat the weed problem. We paid premiums to back what was a beautiful park and now it is an eyesore. What once was new sod (approx 7 years ago) has now become over run with fox tails, dandelions and other noxious weeds. What?s even more frustrating is we spent thousands of dollars to landscape our yards and now all the foxtail and dandelion seeds blow into our yards. I will attach photos of Norseman Park behind my house (5028 Cornell Gate). Following my email l last year, the City sent a Parks Manager to my house. All he did was make excuses as to why nothing is being done to combat the weeds. Once again nothing was done to correct the problem. Myself and many of my neighbours want action.

He said for the past three years he has called the city every year to complain about a water leak and the staff only put up a barricade over the leak and never fix it. He said most of the park is not irrigated, supposedly because the irrigation system not working, and the other half of the park is always under water because of the water leak. He is also concerned that the northeast corner of the park has not been rototilled around the shrub beds.

The grass they planted all died and there is now nothing but weeds here. There are a lot of pickup trucks from the city daily, but they never accomplish anything. The major concern here is the weeds. Our subdivision is surrounded by fields and these are not regularly maintained. The seeds blow from the fields and carry to the finished grass. It doesn?t take long for weeds to overtake the grass when the only thing they do for weeds is cut them here. At this point the entire easement is at a point where it requires a lot of work. It?s got barely any grass growing. The only thing that grows there seems to be weeds.

The workers didn?t remove any of the weeds prior to the seed application and now the weeds have completelytaken over the area. The area looks absolutely horrible. All you see are weeds and any grass growth is minimal. This is unacceptable. These weeds are very large and go to seed in between cuttings. They are making a mess that is spreading around to others lawns. The city needs to take better care of preventing and removing weeds. Especially in areas near open fieldswhere weeds tend to spread rapidly. The crews come to water and cut the weeds, but do not ever bend down to actually pull out the weeds. This is why this is an ongoing problem. Although weeds cannot be sprayed at this point due to the ?grass? being new;the crews need to be pulling them. There is hardly any space for grass to grow with the influx in weeds all over the area. The weeds are quite large and invasive. Most are foxtails, ragweed, thistles, tall hedge mustard etc. Daytona homes is building brandnew builds that back onto this area, listed at $545,000. How will these homes sell? How is it acceptable to cut weeds short and consider this ground cover? If the city could not take care of this area, then the city should have never approved the westerraplan.

To date no weeds have been pulled and the area continues to be overtaken by weeds. I was out for a walk and talked to a city worker this afternoon, who was watering the weeds in the easement. She advised me that management has instructed staff to not pull the weeds. Why are you communicating the opposite message to residents? Clearly your staff is not on the same page and there is a disconnect. This is unacceptable, not only is the city not looking after this area, but they are also providing false or misleading information to residents stating they will pull weeds in the area, when they have actually instructed their staff to not do that. Please explain what is going on with this situation. Whoever is in charge of this project is not fulfilling their role. This area needs to be looked after. We are home owners and tax payers.

We built this house from new starting with 16 years ago we were literally about the second house on the block. This morning I?m waking up and I?m sitting out in the front of my house and insteadof looking at a beautiful park I?m looking at a chain-link fence that looks like a prison literally 20 feet from the end of my property. I?m wondering why this was required considering I haven?t seen any damage or break-ins on my property or evidence of suchin the shed across the street from me at all in the time that I?ve lived here. I think not only does it go against the whole point of the park which just have a beautiful green space but I don?t see it helping the property value of my house either. I am greatly disappointed that no consulting was done as I believe I am the property mostaffected by doing this. I would like somebody to contact me so I can discuss further thank you,7/22/22 12:43,1.0,50.4373569,-104.5266449,PRINCE OF WALES PARK,0.0,3800 E CUMBERLAND RD,50.4373569,-104.5266449,Chain link fence,3800 E CUMBERLAND RD,EAST,12

7/29/22 14:25,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"I have submitted previous requests on this same subject. The grass in the ditch on Courtney St. north of Mapleford Gate needs to be cut. I don?t understand what for years they were able to do it all in one day. Now a full size tractorshows up to cut the slope of the ditch. It usually makes one or two passes and then drives down the road (Courtney) and leaves, then the whipper snipper shows up the same day or a day or two before or after, then a day or two before or after that a ridinglawn mower shows up to cut 4 passes behind ours fences (sometime they cut to the fence and others they leave a large space behind the fence uncut). I just don?t understand why something that was done in one day for 10 years, now has changed to a 2-5 day project. Also, a sign was placed on the west side of the ditch (Corner of Courtney and Mapleford Gate - northwest corner). It says, ?A growing frenzy can be a colossoil mistake.? They cut the grass, on the corner, to place the sign but it is hypocritical to then leavethe full westside ditch overgrown with weeds and wild grass. Lastly, we have trees in the ditch behind our home (7230 Maple Way). Four of them died or their growth is very stunned because they never got any water in the spring. For these trees to survive and thrive they need some help with water. I am not willing touse my own because of the cost of water/sewer. In fact, I purchased many rain barrels after having $360 water bill, in the summer months, a few years ago. Can you please see that these area, I have mention, get attention and maybe have a supervisor drive by every week or second week to see that they are giving this the attention it deserves?Courtney Street and Mapleford Gate, north east and west ditch north of Mapleford Gate and (I think the school side - west - is called) Mapleford Blvd.",7/29/22 14:29,1.0,50.4941761,-104.686848,HAYWORTH CRESCENT PARK,0.5626273839831281,750 RINK AVE,50.4905199,-104.68135,Lack of upkeep,    COURTNEY ST,WEST,131

This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response. We recently received an insert with our water bill indicating ""overgrown grass doesn't cut it"" we find this in direct contradiction to the manner in which the City of Regina takes care of the berm behind our property at 22 Wesson Bay. We have called last year and again this year, several times, to have the city crew to do weed and grass cutting in this area. So far this year they have run through the berm, seemingly at random, and made swathes through this area. Unfortunately a good portionof the area is left untouched and is now is over 2 feet high and full of weeds. (Dandelions and thistles) Your operator goes no where near our property fence - although along Gordon Road they manage to go right up to the property lines and cut ALL of the bermnot just random swathes. The one conclusion we have arrived at is that the city is only concerned about maintaining berms that can be seen easily by road traffic. The city insert's message should be heeded by the city itself. ""Overgrown grass doesn't cut it"" The message is that the city is ready to ""FINE"" tax payers for unkept property but apparently not willing to live up to their own standards.

8/4/22 11:07,Parks Inquiry,PrkGrbEmpt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"1. Positioning of garbage bins along the pathways: In Harbor Landing there are multi-use pathways extending all the way from Highway 1A to Parliament Ave. On these pathways the garbage bins are placed next to the benches. People using these benches are forced to endure the stink emanating from these bins inaddition to being bothered by the flies and other insects infesting these bins. Also, some people throw the garbage into these bins from a distance, resulting in these falling on the benches sometimes. Hence, people, particularly senior residents, who use these paths for walking in the early mornings and late evenings and who would like to take some rest in between their walks are deterred from using these benches by the stink and the insects. Placing thegarbage bins in close proximity to the benches negates the very purpose for which these benches were installed in the first place. Could these garbage bins be relocated to at least 15- 20 feet away from the benches? It would also be beneficial if more benches are provided along the pathways. 2. Trees along the pathways: As the summers become hotter around the world, many cities around the world are increasing their tree cover to mitigate the heat and also reduce carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We in Regina should be planting more trees particularly in the new neighborhoods. I have been using the multi-use pathway in Harbor landing for a number of years now and find that there is not a single tree along these pathways. During summer, the only time that the people, particularly the elderly can use these pathways are early morningor in the late evening, around sunset. At all other times, it is very hot and tiring to walk on these pathways. I have occasionally noticed older people looking around for some shade during their walks. Hence, I suggest that the City of Regina should plant shade giving trees along these pathways, staggered at intervals of 20 feet on both sides of the pathways. Initially these can be planted on the unpaved pathways, leaving the paved ones for those who wantto walk in the sun.

8/8/22 11:39,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"I am writing today to comment (complain) about the recent lack of maintenance in Plainview Park. Seven year's ago we moved into the neighborhood and have thoroughly enjoyed the use of the park. The path was maintained yearly with scraping, new gravel, and weed control. Over the last 3 years this has fallen by the wayside ( understandably due to covid for 3 years). Now there has been nothing done this year. The weeds have almost completely grown across the path and the gopher holes are becoming quite dangerous. Our neighborhood demographics will show that most people around here are quite older and have high incomes. Most of which have small dogs which like to use the park on a daily basis. For 6 years I have been taking my snow blower and keeping the almost 1/2km of path clear after every snowfall, with occasional help and financial assistance from other neighbors. Last year it proved to he a monumental task with the portion along the southern fence line becoming overwhelming by the end of season. Personally, I enjoy helping out the neighborhood pet lovers but there are some things I just can't do. 1- I would like to see the path repaired with the weeds removed and fresh gravel. 2- I would ask if there is any way the city could assist with winter maintenance. Perhaps with snow fencing along the southern fence line and the occasional pass with the sidewalk snow plow after heavy winter storms? I know this is asking a lot but this has been one of Regina's more elite neighborhoods for many years. I hope that you can assist in keeping this classic neighborhood and park beautiful.Location Plainview Park on Plainview Road in Albert Park.",8/8/22 11:42,1.0,50.3986,-104.62139,PLAINSVIEW PARK,1.5801749476133684e-12,61 PLAINSVIEW DR,50.39859999999999,-104.62139,Lack of maintenance,61   PLAINSVIEW DR,SOUTH,5

The city was supposed to have a team out pulling weeds and I have been watching daily and none has been pulling weeds. The area is more weeds than grass in most places and looks absolutely disgusting. The edges especially and the west side of the path are even even worse condition. The gardens at Sereda park are full of weeds and there is also increased weeds throughout sharp park. Can they please do something to control the spread of the invasive foxtails and other weeds etc. There is a section of sod which is completely missing from sharp park (cricket pitch) along the walking path. This needs to be replaced. They need to have people here pulling the weeds and making appropriate use of time. It is a waste of time to send people to water the weeds in the easement, while it is raining. I constantly see teams of people here, yet one person has a hose watering the weeds and the others are standing around drinking coffee and smoking. The easement backs onto Daytona homes property and this is a detractor in marketing this new area. Normally green-space should be seen as a positive thing, however no one wishes to back onto a field of weeds, crabgrass and dandelions. It is disgraceful that Westerra was given a landscaping award in 2018. This award should be taken away from westerra based on how the city has let this area completely go. The boulevards on Canolla ave in front of the area zoned for commercial development look horrendous. It seems like the city is not keeping up with practices to minimize the spread of weeds from the fields. The area is progressively looking worse as time goes on. Cutting weeds is not minimizing the spread, since adjacent fields are full of invasive weeds. Please take further action in resolving the issues described above.

The location that I am referring to is the spray pad on Maple Ridge Drive. There is a large hole approximately 2.5 ft long x 1 ft wide x 1 ft deep located within inches of designated play area. This hole regularly fills with water as kids play in the area which not only creates the hazard of kids not realizing the hole is there, but a massive mud pit taking away from the enjoyment of the park. This hole has been there for at least 2 years and I have witnessed several kids falling into the hole and hurting themselves. Myself and other Maple Ridge residents have expressed our concerns to City or Regina employees working in the park and so far the only steps to address our concerns have been to fill the hole with more dirt (which has already eroded) and covering it with a barricade, which I believe creates additional hazard with kids running around it on a daily basis.

8/30/22 8:31,Parks Inquiry,WeedsCity,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"Hi there, residents of Westerra are concerned over the increasing number of weeds growing in the easement on the west side of the walking path along wheat st. The city failed to remove the weeds from the beginning when they spread seed, which is the reason for the abundance of weeds through the area. It appears that the city needs to focus on weed control in this area. This is a new development which had the common areas sodded back in 2016. The problem is that feilds are open to the areawithout separation and this causing transfer of weeds to any finished area. The parks are getting increasing numbers of weeds and foxtails, due to no proper weed removal. Dandelions are constantly going to seed before the area is cut. I am concerned for the future of this area as it appears the city is neglecting this neighbour hood. We are tax payers and we request the common areas to be taken care of to an acceptable standard. There should be primarily grass in common areas, instead of primarily weeds. Please have maintenance crews pull weeds from the easement and around Sereda park. Sereda park.

The department is not required to respond however if a response is provided, ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.Good afternoon, I had a voice message dated August 29 from Ron McPhail who lives at 1930 MacPherson Avenue. He is concerned about the overgrown trees and shrubs in the easement behind his street (MacPherson) and Cross Place. He knows that the easement has gas lines and Sask Power poles that need to be accessed by the utility companies and that the easements need to be kept accessible. He said when he calls the city about overgrown grass, the city sends workers out to cut the grass. He is thankful for that. His main concerns is that other households allow trees and shrubs from their properties to grow into the easement. He would like better enforcement from the city and if the property owners do not cut their trees/shrubs, that the city should remove them at the property owners? cost. If you would like to follow up with Mr. McPhail about this issue, he can be reached at 306-584-1294.

9/12/22 13:29,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"This service request has been created in response to an inquiry originally sent to Councillor Stevens. This response requires subject matter expertise from the department. The department is now asked to respond directly to the resident and ensure the noted Council members are copied on the response.The following issues were brought to my attention by Adrienne Reison (a_rae13@hotmail.com). It relates to park maintenance, pathways, and rail safety. Pictures and maps attached. It looks like a beaver is damaging trees near the park on 1st avenue. The text from her Facebook message is below. Please include me on the response. ""Also I don't know how much say you get in city space funds allocation. But for our area this little area is pretty much the most important walking area. It would be nice to see some pathways improvement. Families who walk or ride there bikesgo through constantly. It's also how most people who don't drive in the neighborhood get there groceries (giant Tiger) you would likely be shocked by the amount of people that walk over the train tracks daily or carry wagons or grocery carts over in this area to get there. You can see from Google people have made paths to walk over the tracks. Obviously I don't think that anything could be done at the railway but more gravel on the walkways or a paved path to the bridge in the city area would be great."" ""We would definitely be against fencing, it would cut off our access walking it as well. It really needs an actual path over which would make it safer but that's likely not feasible. Fencing would all be damaged very quickly as well. I'm guessing people would cut through it like they have near Toys r us, and a few other places they have fenced the area.

Block 115W is a unique area in this cemetery where 8 inch, 9 inch and 11 inch etc. monument base heights have been allowed and constructed on the cemetery plots and is the reason we have stayed in this Block 115W. We had purchased our Monument with an 8 inch base on March 8, 2022. I was notified by Remco the week of September 6, 2022 that the city had changed their guidelines. According to the City they had changed their rules in May 2022 to not allow any base greater than 6 inches high. They are telling Remco that I can not have an 8 inch monument base. Given that I purchased the monument with an 8 inch base before May 2022 I should be allowed to have it installed. Since this Block 115W is almost full and others have been allowed to have their own non conforming monument bases constructed within it we also want the same fair treatment. Please allow us to put our prepaid constructed monument with 8 inch base on our double plot. Thank you for looking into this at your earliest convenience so that my family can be treated equally and have the 8 inch monument base constructed in Block 115W as others do.",9/16/22 8:11,3.0,50.4340403,-104.5960116,PEART PARK,0.2982412456947809,2851 OTTAWA ST,50.43508139999999,-104.5998923,Complaint is about 8 inch monument base,10370   WASCANA ESTS,CENTRAL,109

We love the area and are always happy to see the construction crews around. Especially the excavators who provide endless entertainment to our two little girls. I am writing this morning to express my sadness and confusion regarding the sidewalk and street update to Reeve's Road and Bay. I am happy to see this work being done. It was a bumpy street that did needed a lift. However, I am disappointed that at the connection point between the two walking paths that Reeves Road separates there were no accessible ramps made to connect the two paths easily. Instead, there is a large 90 degree curb created. This leads all families who use the path (which has a playground in it) to have to go down the road to a sloped curb, and then cut back to the path when using a stroller, bike, sled, or anything of the like (wheelchair, electric scooter). In addition within the first park that starts on Neff Road, there is a VERY steep wood bridge that is very treacherous for people of all ages, especially during winter months as it's more than a 45 degree angle downwards, and is very slippery. It does not have to be so steep as while it is a water channel, there has no need for it during the 7 years we have lived in the area. It's excessively high. For a family friendly area our walkable greenspaces have become less child friendly and it makes me sad in those spots when we take walks to use the park or to walk to the SSLC and it's a bit more a headache than purely enjoying the beautiful paths our city has provided.

Kristina Service Request #2193410 &amp; 2137459 - Cuts Inquiry - Rochdale Park Thks for your email. Hard to believe the condition of this trail is not a concern to the city. I guess it will take a person to trip over the fluctuations in the uneven paved surface or twist their ankle inthe huge depression obstacles and then sue the city. Secondly why is the city closing the hot asphalt plant on Oct 21st? Why not keep the plant operational and continue to repair major issues such as the Rochdale trail since these repairs were to be donein the spring of 2022.
