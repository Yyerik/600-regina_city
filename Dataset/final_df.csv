6/2/22 9:20,Parks Inquiry,ParksMnt,Parks Maintenance & Cemeteries,"june 1st - i would like to bring to your attention a situation that happened this morning that i feel should be made known and rectified. i?m a long time resident of uplands and take my dogs to the new dog park in the mount pleasant dog park every morning. i love the dog park, it?s great. this morning i went with my two dogs as usual and noticed that there were some city workers weed wacking both inside and outside of the fenced compound. we went in the front gates and i let my dogs free. we made the loop almost all the way around until we got to the east side of the park. there were several city workers weed wacking at the fence and a we got closer i realized they had the fence wide open. my dogs beelined it and escaped. the city worker closest to the gate saw them coming and just stood there and smiled. i was too far away to even try to catch up. my two large dogs were now loose. this is a danger for a number of reasons. my dogs could have attacked another dog or person and hurt them. they could have run out into traffic and been killed. it took me an hour to chase after them and finally get them leashed. as you can imagine, i was not impressed. if an incident had occurred, i would have held the city liable and taken legal action. this is not an acceptable way to conduct work in and around a compound directly built to contain potentially dangerous if loose animals. to prevent future incidents, i propose that either a: signage is put up at both entrances, alerting dog owners that the gates are open so that they do not let their dogs off leash. or b: inform workers that the gates of any off leash dog park under maintenance should remain closed at all times to prevent dangerous incidents from occurring. i appreciate your time to read this letter and i hope you will take actions to prevent any further situations from occurring.",6/2/22 9:39,1.0,50.4880054,-104.6030728,ELMVIEW EAST PARK,0.2381856349031172,202 ELMVIEW RD,50.48987,-104.60473,Loose dogs,126   LLOYD CRES,NORTH,75,2022,6,4,9,Summer,20,75_dogs_offleash_leash_escaping,maintenance,maintenance

(dandelions and thistles) your operator goes no where near our property fence - although along gordon road they manage to go right up to the property lines and cut all of the bermnot just random swathes. the one conclusion we have arrived at is that the city is only concerned about maintaining berms that can be seen easily by road traffic. the city insert's message should be heeded by the city itself. ""overgrown grass doesn't cut it"" the message is that the city is ready to ""fine"" tax payers for unkept property but apparently not willing to live up to their own standards. do as we say not as we do seems to be the standard in the case of our area.",8/2/22 8:45,1.0,50.4046778,-104.6425084,RYAN PARK,0.4386680285092832,51 RYAN RD,50.40099,-104.64031,Lack of Maintenance,22   WESSON BAY,SOUTH,5,2022,8,2,8,Summer,75,5_lack_maintenance_of_maintenancel,weeds,landscape construction and management
