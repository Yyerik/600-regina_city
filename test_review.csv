3,"Agree with the other reviewer who said the shorts just wouldn't stop growing. I ordered the smaller of the two sizes I am between. Shorts were adorable on and I was happy. Ripped the tags off and wore them out. By the end of my day, they had stretched out so it looked like I was in someone else's clothing. Crotch hung down inches practically to my knees. Butt was enormous and shapeless. I thought maybe I would be able to restore the size by shrinking them, but the hottest wash cycle and high temp dryer seemed to have no effect. I would order two sizes down from your regular size and wear them for about an hour at home with tags on before you decide to keep. For the same price, there's a pair of Joe's Jeans cuffed denim shorts on sale that are even cuter and stay their proper size all day. (And honestly, the $19 pair I got from target was as cute as these Caskon shorts and had no stretching issues.)"
3,I’m 5’2 at 150lbs and I bought a size M. I wanted to love them but they are just not for women who have thighs! My booty cheeks were eating those shorts out. I would definitely say size up. Unfortunately I will be returning them.
3,"I read about these shorts on a fashion blog. I am a true size 6/28 in jeans. I purchased two sizes (26,27), since other reviews said they run big. The 26 fit me well and was comfortable. For reference I'm 5'4"" 145 lbs."
5,Love these! Listened to the reviews and sized down and they fit perfect! Normally wear a size small in athletic shorts so I ordered these in XS and I love they way they fit.
2,"I’m around 135lbs and 5’3. I’m typically a medium in most things, but I always get a small in athletic shorts because of my height. For comparison, I’m a 6 in lululemon shorts and leggings. So I got these in a small, and they were HUGE! Definitely recommend sizing down!!!"
2,"I ordered a medium and a small. The medium was too big and I kept the small which fit if I wore it a bit higher on my waist. After washing them 2 times and air drying them, the waistband won’t lay flat. It’s all scrunched up and I have to constantly fix it. It’s super annoying."
5,Finally a pair of comfortable shorts for those of us with a tummy and a butt! No chafing. No riding up. Fits true to size. Great length. Not too short but not Bermuda’s. I’m 5’8 and 220. I ordered an xl and they fit great. Very generous in size.
4,Bought these for a family trip. Material was quick dry- so perfect layered with an active top for hiking & heading to the beach. With a linen & sandals it worked for casual dinners. Pockets big enough to toss my phone in between photos. Bought my normal size (medium) but if between size probably order down. Taking 1 star off because I spilled something (maybe oil?) & it stained easily.
5,"These are great shorts to wear around the house, or with a cute top out. They are lightweight and not too high waisted. The pockets are cut in a way that do not add bulk to the hips. I’m 5’3”, 130 pounds and the small fits me perfectly."
5,"Seriously in love with this dress. The fabric is thick and luxe but not stifling, and the cinched waist keeps the feminine outline. Plus pockets for phone and keys! Will be wearing this one all summer. For reference I am 5’7” and 155lbs and got the medium, love the fit."
5,"I bought this dress in both charcoal and the navy expecting to only keep one but have since purchased the light grey too and am keeping all three. These dresses are amazing! TTS. I usually wear a size Medium/8 but a lot of times size down to a small for dresses. I purchased Mediums and they fit perfectly. The fabric is thick and forgiving. The dress is form fitting without being revealing. The gathered waist is perfect for hiding any lower belly pouches. It is casual but more put together than shorts and a tee. Overall, the perfect summer staple for warm weather."
3,"From the front it looks so classy and stylish. From the back though…it clings to your butt in a way that you can see EVERYTHING. Tried it on for several people and they all had the funniest raised eyebrows after seeing it from the back. Makes it look like you’re trying to show off. For me, I wanted this as a skirt for work and it’s definitely not"
5,"This knit skirt is soft in feel and rich in color. The length is an excellent pairing for your casual bulky sweater and loafers or more fitted suit jacket and high heel situation. You will be outfitted perfectly because it's a versatile piece. Now ladies, it's a knit so wear your undergarments for the best and smoothest look possible. This skirt is true to size but you still need to wear pantyhose with control or the smoothing garment of your choice. I am tall and curvy and this piece fits the bill for most of my fall fashion affairs."
3,"I should have listened to the reviews that said this was too revealing. Maybe would have worked if I sized up, but sadly, must go back."
5,"Wore it on a long international flight. Very comfy yet fitted and smoothing, held its shape and washed well. Please offer more dark colors for fall."
5,"Over 2 decades ago I bought a black skirt almost identical to this one & it is TIMELESS. The midi pencil is the most versatile style & a closet staple for a reason. Dress her up with pointy toe pumps or with a casual flat, this stretch knit will wear well in cold and warm seasons. Conceals all the lady lumps & bumps so no shapewear necessary"
3,"This skirt was great at first! The only thing I would say is that because I am shorter, I wish the slit was a bit higher. Other than that, this skirt was beautiful. I only wore it a few times, but now the fabric has pilled so bad. It feels cheap now. Like old clothing, which is unfortunate because of the amount of money I spent on it. This is a good skirt, but unfortunately, I think it’s overpriced for the quality of fabric you are receiving."
5,This is adorable! Love the navy and fit! I'm 5'4 118 and it's a great length. Not too short at all and it cinched waist is flattering on my hourglass figure. I have my usual xs and it's perfect! Cute for the 4th of July chasing my little boys around!
5,Dress is a staple! I typically wear a size 10 in dresses and have a larger bosom so I opted for the XL. It held me well together. For reference I’m 5’3 and 180lbs. It made me look slimmer and supported my girls. The chest was really fitted and the bodice was almost baggy on me but the dress still looked beautiful on.
5,"This dress was absolutely beautiful and fit me so well. I am 5’3 around 132 pounds and while the stomach area and bust area was a little snug it fit really well! I’m usually a size 2/4 in dresses but I sized up to the size small which should fit a 4/6 and I’m glad I did! If you’re between sizes, size up!"
5,"I am so excited about this buy. It is exactly what I visualized and more. I got to wear it for a TG get-together and could not be happier with it. I bought a 10 and have very large hips so I was concerned since there was no stretch in the fabric; but, ironically, it is what I love about the dress because it is extremely classy. Can't wait to wear it again."
4,"This is such a gorgeous dress. High quality material and a beautiful cut and style. Very unique. I would have given it 5 stars except I found the fit a bit odd. I am normally a size 2 in dresses. Originally I purchased this dress in an XS (2-4 my typical) but it was so tight around my waist I couldn't breathe (I am a 26-27 waist) while the chest area fit fine. So I returned it and then purchased the Small (size 6 which is usually too big for me). It was STILL a little tight around the waist but baggier up top. I love the dress so much that I took it to the tailor and had her take out the waist a bit and cinch the chest area. Now it fits perfectly. Just disappointed I had to spend the extra money to get the fit right. In any case, I would still buy this dress again. It is that pretty. I got the teal color and have received so many compliments on it."
2,"Weird fit, I ordered down a size since so many people said it was loose up top and I could barely fit it over my shoulders."
3,"I like this dress. It's nice material. That being said, it fit really small on my body. For reference I am a 34C, narrow waist, larger hips 5'8"". I thought it was really short for my liking and super tight across the chest. I don't know. I'm going to exchange my mediums for larges and see if there's a bit more length and room. I will say I don't like my clothes super tight either."
4,"Sadly, these did not work for me, but I did think they were really nice. The fabric is yummy! I do believe they run a bit short. I am 5' 8"" and felt like they were just too short."
2,too loose. I ordered the same pants same size in a different color - and they fit much better. Other wise they are very comfortable. Casual.
5,Fit very nice and make you look slim
1,once washed they were 2 sizes smaller
5,"My go to pants. Love that sit lower on hips, just the right amount of loose, not too baggy, not too tight.. lightweight.. absolutely will be buying more! Tossed my Lululemon joggers for these!"
5,"These are the most comfortable joggers I’ve ever owned…and they fit better than any other style and brand that I’ve tried. Soft, gentle waistband and breathable material (for polyester). They look nice enough for running errands and I can walk the dog in them (although I would avoid long hikes). For reference I’m 5’3” and 128# with a shorter inseam and the small fits perfectly."
